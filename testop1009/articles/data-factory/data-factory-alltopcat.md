| 8 |[Create, monitor, and manage Azure data factories using Data Factory .NET SDK](data-factory-create-data-factories-programmatically.md) |** Login without popup dialog box** The above sample code launches a dialog box for you to enter Azure credentials. If you need to sign-in programmatically without using a dialog-box, see  Authenticating a service principal with Azure Resource Manager (resource-group-authenticate-service-principal.md authenticate-service-principal-with-certificate---powershell). ** Example** Create GetAuthorizationHeaderNoPopup method as shown below:     public static string GetAuthorizationHeaderNoPopup()     {         var authority = new Uri(new Uri("https://login.windows.net"), ConfigurationManager.AppSettings "ActiveDirectoryTenantId" );         var context = new AuthenticationContext(authority.AbsoluteUri);         var credential = new ClientCredential(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings "AdfClientId" , ConfigurationManager.AppSettings "AdfClientSecret" );         AuthenticationResult result = context.AcquireTokenAsync(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings "WindowsManagementUri" , credential).Result; |
| 9 |[Move data using Copy Activity](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) |** Supported file formats** Copy Activity can copy files as-is between two file-based data stores such as Azure Blob, File System, and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).  To do so, you can skip the  format section (data-factory-create-datasets.md) in both input and output dataset definitions, and the data is copied efficiently without any serialization/deserialization. Copy Activity also reads from and writes to files in specified formats: text, Avro, ORC, and JSON.  Here are some examples of copy activities you can achieve: /    Copy data in text (CSV) format from Azure Blob and write to Azure SQL /    Copy files in text (CSV) format from File System on-premises and write to Azure Blob in Avro format /    Copy data in Azure SQL Database and write to HDFS on-premises in ORC format ** a. name="global"../a.Globally available data movement** The service that powers Copy Activity is available globally in the following regions and geographies, even though Azure Data Factory is available only in the West US, East US, and North Europe regions. |
