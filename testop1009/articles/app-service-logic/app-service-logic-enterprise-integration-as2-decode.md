# Get started with Decode AS2 Message
Connect to Decode AS2 Message to establish security and reliability while transmitting messages. It provides digital signing, decryption, and acknowledgements via Message Disposition Notifications (MDN).

## Create the connection
### Prerequisites
* An Azure account; you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
* An Integration Account is required to use Decode AS2 message connector. See details on how to create an [Integration Account](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md), [partners](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-partners.md) and an [AS2 agreement](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-as2.md)

### Connect to Decode AS2 Message using the following steps:
1. [Create a Logic App](app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md) provides an example.
2. This connector does not have any triggers. Use other triggers to start the Logic App, such as a Request trigger.  In the Logic App designer, add a trigger and add an action.  Select Show Microsoft managed APIs in the drop-down list and then enter “AS2” in the search box.  Select AS2 – Decode AS2 Message
   
    ![Search AS2](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-AS2connector/as2decodeimage1.png)
3. If you haven’t previously created any connections to Integration Account, you are prompted for the connection details
   
    ![Create integration connection](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-AS2connector/as2decodeimage2.png)
4. Enter the Integration Account details.  Properties with an asterisk are required
   
   | Property | Details |
   | --- | --- |
   | Connection Name * |Enter any name for your connection |
   | Integration Account * |Enter the Integration Account name. Be sure your Integration Account and Logic app are in the same Azure location |
   
      Once complete, your connection details look similar to the following
   
      ![integration connection](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-AS2connector/as2decodeimage3.png)
5. Select **Create**
6. Notice the connection has been created.  Now, proceed with the other steps in your Logic App
   
    ![integration connection created](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-AS2connector/as2decodeimage4.png) 
7. Select Body and Headers from Request outputs
   
    ![provide mandatory fields](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-AS2connector/as2decodeimage5.png) 

## The AS2 Decode does the following
* Processes AS2/HTTP headers
* Verifies the signature (if configured)
* Decrypts the messages (if configured)
* Decompresses the message (if configured)
* Reconciles a received MDN with the original outbound message
* Updates and correlates records in the non-repudiation database
* Writes records for AS2 status reporting
* The output payload contents are base64 encoded
* Determines whether an MDN is required, and whether the MDN should be synchronous or asynchronous based on configuration in AS2 agreement
* Generates a synchronous or asynchronous MDN (based on agreement configurations)
* Sets the correlation tokens and properties on the MDN

## Try it for yourself
Why not give it a try. Click [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/templates/201-logic-app-as2-send-receive/) to deploy a fully operational logic app of your own using the Logic Apps AS2 features
