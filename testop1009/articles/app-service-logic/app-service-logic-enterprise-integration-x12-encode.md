# Get started with Encode X12 Message
Validates EDI and partner-specific properties, converts XML-encoded messages into EDI transaction sets in the interchange and requests a Technical and/or Functional acknowledgment

## Create the connection
### Prerequisites
* An Azure account; you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
* An Integration Account is required to use Encode x12 message connector. See details on how to create an [Integration Account](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md), [partners](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-partners.md) and [X12 agreement](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-x12.md)

### Connect to Encode X12 Message using the following steps:
1. [Create a Logic App](app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md) provides an example
2. This connector does not have any triggers. Use other triggers to start the Logic App, such as a Request trigger.  In the Logic App designer, add a trigger and add an action.  Select Show Microsoft managed APIs in the drop-down list and then enter “x12” in the search box.  Select either X12 - Encode X12 Message by agreement name or X12 - Encode to X 12 message by identities.  
   
    ![search x12](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-x12connector/x12decodeimage1.png) 
3. If you haven’t previously created any connections to Integration Account, you are prompted for the connection details
   
    ![integration account connection](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-x12connector/x12encodeimage1.png) 
4. Enter the Integration Account details.  Properties with an asterisk are required
   
   | Property | Details |
   | --- | --- |
   | Connection Name * |Enter any name for your connection |
   | Integration Account * |Enter the Integration Account name. Be sure your Integration Account and Logic app are in the same Azure location |
   
    Once complete, your connection details look similar to the following
   
    ![integration account connection created](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-x12connector/x12encodeimage2.png) 
5. Select **Create**
6. Notice the connection has been created.

#### X12 - Encode X12 Message by agreement name
1. Select X12 agreement from the drop-down and xml message to encode.
   
    ![provide mandatory fields](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-x12connector/x12encodeimage4.png) 

#### X12 - Encode X12 Message by identities
1. Provide sender identifier, sender qualifier, receiver identifier, and receiver qualifier as configured in the X12 agreement.  Select xml message to encode
   
   ![provide mandatory fields](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-x12connector/x12encodeimage5.png) 

## X12 Encode does following:
* Agreement resolution by matching sender and receiver context properties.
* Serializes the EDI interchange, converting XML-encoded messages into EDI transaction sets in the interchange.
* Applies transaction set header and trailer segments
* Generates an interchange control number, a group control number, and a transaction set control number for each outgoing interchange
* Replaces separators in the payload data
* Validates EDI and partner-specific properties
  * Schema validation of the transaction-set data elements against the message Schema
  * EDI validation performed on transaction-set data elements.
  * Extended validation performed on transaction-set data elements
* Requests a Technical and/or Functional acknowledgment (if configured).
  * A Technical Acknowledgment generates as a result of header validation. The technical acknowledgment reports the status of the processing of an interchange header and trailer by the address receiver
  * A Functional Acknowledgment generates as a result of body validation. The functional acknowledgment reports each error encountered while processing the received document
