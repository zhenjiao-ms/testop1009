# Get started with Decode X12 Message
Validates EDI and partner-specific properties, generates XML document for each transaction set and generates acknowledgment for processed transaction.

## Create the connection
### Prerequisites
* An Azure account; you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
* An Integration Account is required to use Decode X12 message connector. See details on how to create an [Integration Account](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md), [partners](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-partners.md) and [X12 agreement](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-x12.md)

### Connect to Decode X12 Message using the following steps:
1. [Create a Logic App](app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md) provides an example
2. This connector does not have any triggers. Use other triggers to start the Logic App, such as a Request trigger.  In the Logic App designer, add a trigger and add an action.  Select Show Microsoft managed APIs in the drop-down list and then enter “x12” in the search box.  Select X12 – Decode X12 Message
   
    ![search x12](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-x12connector/x12decodeimage1.png)  
3. If you haven’t previously created any connections to Integration Account, you are prompted for the connection details
   
    ![integration account connection](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-x12connector/x12decodeimage4.png)     
4. Enter the Integration Account details.  Properties with an asterisk are required
   
   | Property | Details |
   | --- | --- |
   | Connection Name * |Enter any name for your connection |
   | Integration Account * |Enter the Integration Account name. Be sure your Integration Account and Logic app are in the same Azure location |
   
    Once complete, your connection details look similar to the following

5. Select **Create**
6. Notice the connection has been created.

## X12 Decode does following
* Validates the envelope against trading partner agreement
* Generates an XML document for each transaction set.
* Validates EDI and partner-specific properties
  * EDI structural validation, and extended schema validation
  * Validation of the structure of the interchange envelope.
  * Schema validation of the envelope against the control schema.
  * Schema validation of the transaction-set data elements against the message schema.
  * EDI validation performed on transaction-set data elements 
* Verifies that the interchange, group, and transaction set control numbers are not duplicates
  * Checks the interchange control number against previously received interchanges.
  * Checks the group control number against other group control numbers in the interchange.
  * Checks the transaction set control number against other transaction set control numbers in that group.
* Converts the entire interchange to XML 
  * Split Interchange as transaction sets - suspend transaction sets on error: Parses each transaction set in an interchange into a separate XML document. If one or more transaction sets in the interchange fail validation, X12 Decode suspends only those transaction sets.
  * Split Interchange as transaction sets - suspend interchange on error: Parses each transaction set in an interchange into a separate XML document.  If one or more transaction sets in the interchange fail validation, X12 Decode suspends the entire interchange.
  * Preserve Interchange - suspend transaction sets on error: Creates an XML document for the entire batched interchange. X12 Decode suspends only those transaction sets that fail validation, while continuing to process all other transaction sets
  * Preserve Interchange - suspend interchange on error: Creates an XML document for the entire batched interchange. If one or more transaction sets in the interchange fail validation, X12 Decode suspends the entire interchange, 
* Generates a Technical and/or Functional acknowledgment (if configured).
  * A Technical Acknowledgment generates as a result of header validation. The technical acknowledgment reports the status of the processing of an interchange header and trailer by the address receiver.
  * A Functional Acknowledgment generates as a result of body validation. The functional acknowledgment reports each error encountered while processing the received document
