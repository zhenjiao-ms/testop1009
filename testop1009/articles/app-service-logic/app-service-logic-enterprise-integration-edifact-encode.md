# Get started with Encode EDIFACT Message
Validates EDI and partner-specific properties 

## Create the connection
### Prerequisites
* An Azure account; you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
* An Integration Account is required to use Encode EDIFACT message connector. See details on how to create an [Integration Account](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md), [partners](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-partners.md) and [EDIFACT agreement](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-edifact.md)

### Connect to Decode EDIFACT Message using the following steps:
1. [Create a Logic App](app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md) provides an example.
2. This connector does not have any triggers. Use other triggers to start the Logic App, such as a Request trigger.  In the Logic App designer, add a trigger and add an action.  Select Show Microsoft managed APIs in the drop-down list and then enter "EDIFACT" in the search box.  Select either Encode EDIFACT Message by agreement name or Encode to EDIFACT message by identities.
   
    ![search EDIFACT](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-edifactorconnector/edifactdecodeimage1.png)  
3. If you havenâ€™t previously created any connections to Integration Account, you are prompted for the connection details
   
    ![create integration account connection](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-edifactorconnector/edifactencodeimage1.png)  
4. Enter the Integration account details.  Properties with an asterisk are required
   
   | Property | Details |
   | --- | --- |
   | Connection Name * |Enter any name for your connection |
   | Integration Account * |Enter the Integration Account name. Be sure your Integration Account and Logic app are in the same Azure location  |
   
    Once complete, your connection details look similar to the following
   
    ![integration account connection](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-edifactorconnector/edifactencodeimage2.png)
5. Select **Create**
6. Notice the connection has been created

#### Encode EDIFACT Message by agreement name
1. Provide EDIFACT agreement name and xml message to encode.
   
   ![provide mandatory fields](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-edifactorconnector/edifactencodeimage6.png)

#### Encode EDIFACT Message by identities
1. Provide sender identifier, sender qualifier, receiver identifier, and receiver qualifier as configured in the EDIFACT agreement.  Select xml message to encode
   
    ![provide mandatory fields](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-edifactorconnector/edifactencodeimage7.png)

## EDIFACT Encode does following
* Resolve the agreement by matching the sender qualifier & identifier and receiver qualifier and identifier
* Serializes the EDI interchange, converting XML-encoded messages into EDI transaction sets in the interchange.
* Applies transaction set header and trailer segments
* Generates an interchange control number, a group control number, and a transaction set control number for each outgoing interchange
* Replaces separators in the payload data
* Validates EDI and partner-specific properties
  * Schema validation of the transaction-set data elements against the message schema.
  * EDI validation performed on transaction-set data elements.
  * Extended validation performed on transaction-set data elements
* Generates an XML document for each transaction set.
* Requests a Technical and/or Functional acknowledgment (if configured).
  * As a technical acknowledgment, the CONTRL message indicates receipt of an interchange.
  * As a functional acknowledgment, the CONTRL message indicates acceptance or rejection of the received interchange, group, or message, with a list of errors or unsupported functionality
