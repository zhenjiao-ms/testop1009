If your credit card or debit card was declined when you try to sign up for Azure, you might have issues because of one of the reasons below.

* [The accepted credit card and debit card providers vary based on your country, so you may need to use an international card](#credit-or-debit-card-details). In the drop-down list for choosing a credit card, you will only see the options that are valid in the country that you selected. 
* [Your credit or debit card information is inaccurate or incomplete](#credit-or-debit-card-details). You must update your payment info to proceed.
* [You're trying to activate a second free trial](#azure-free-trial); the Azure Free Trial offer is limited to one per user.
* You’re using a virtual or prepaid card. Virtual or prepaid credit or debit cards are not accepted as valid payment options. 
* Your card might be inactive or blocked. If you are indeed using a valid credit card or debit card, make sure that the card is active and your bank is not blocking online transactions due to its security policies. Contact your bank to resolve this issue.

## Credit or debit card details
Follow the steps below to make sure your credit or debit card information is valid:

* The credit or debit card you’re using should be listed in the drop-down list for the country you choose. 
  
  * In some cases, although you’re paying for Azure services in your local/preferred currency, you are purchasing services through a non-local Microsoft entity and your credit card is being processed by a non-local bank. Please contact your bank or card issuer to confirm if your credit card is enabled for international transactions.
  * See [supported countries and currencies](billing-countries-and-currencies.md).
* The name you enter must exactly match the name printed on the credit/debit card, without any additional symbols/characters.
* The address you enter must exactly match the address that appears on the credit/debit card statement, including street address, city, state, country, and zip/postal code.
* The CVV code you enter must exactly match the code that appears on the back or front of the credit/debit card.

After you update your payment information, you can try signing up again.

## Azure Free Trial
The Azure Free Trial offer is limited to one free trial activation per user. If you have already activated a free trial earlier with this credit card or had an Azure subscription in the past that was linked to this credit card, the system will not allow you to activate a free trial now. Instead, use one of the other available Azure plans listed on the [Microsoft Azure Offer Details](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/offer-details/) page.

## Next steps
### Set up invoicing
You can also pay for your Azure subscription via invoicing payment methods such as checks, overnight checks, and wire transfers.

To use the invoice payment option, you must represent a business. This option is not available for individual subscribers. Once your business is set up to pay using the invoice option, you cannot change to a different payment option later.

To start the process of setting up an invoice, see [Azure Billing - How to invoice](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/invoicing/) for details.
