# All topics for Azure SQL Data Warehouse service
This topic lists every topic that applies directly to the **SQL Data Warehouse** service of Azure. You can search this webpage for keywords by using **Ctrl+F**, to find the topics of current interest.

## Updated articles
This section lists articles which were updated recently, where the update was big or significant. For each updated article, a rough snippet of the added markdown text is displayed. The articles were updated within the date range of **2016-07-26** to **2016-08-21**.

| &nbsp; | Article | Updated text, snippet |
| ---:|:--- |:--- |
| 1 |[Concurrency and workload management in SQL Data Warehouse](sql-data-warehouse-develop-concurrency.md) |** Queries which honor concurrency limits** Most queries are governed by resource classes. These queries must fit inside both the concurrent query and concurrency slot thresholds. An end user cannot choose to exclude a query from the concurrency slot model. To reiterate, the following statements do **honor** resource classes: / INSERT-SELECT / UPDATE / DELETE / SELECT (when querying user tables) / ALTER INDEX REBUILD / ALTER INDEX REORGANIZE / ALTER TABLE REBUILD / CREATE INDEX / CREATE CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX / CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) / Data loading / Data movement operations conducted by the Data Movement Service (DMS) ** Query exceptions to concurrency limits** |
| 2 |[Migration to Premium Storage Details](sql-data-warehouse-migrate-to-premium-storage.md) |With the change to Premium Storage, we have also increased the number of database blob files in the underlying architecture of your Data Warehouse.  If you encounter any performance issues, we recommend that you rebuild your Clustered Columnstore Indexes using the script below.  This will force some of your existing data to the additional blobs.  If you take no action, the data will naturally redistribute over time as you load more data into your Data Warehouse tables. **Pre-requisites:** 1.    Data Warehouse should run with 1,000 DWUs or higher (see  scale compute power   ) 2.    User executing the script should be in the  mediumrc role    or higher     1.    To add a user to this role, execute the following:         1.    ````EXEC sp_addrolemember 'xlargerc', 'MyUser'```` ````sql /------------------------------------------------------------------------------ /- Step 1: Create Table to control Index Rebuild /- Run as user in mediumrc or higher /------------------------------------------------------------ |
