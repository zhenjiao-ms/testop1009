# Create an application gateway by using the Azure CLI
Azure Application Gateway is a layer-7 load balancer. It provides failover, performance-routing HTTP requests between different servers, whether they are on the cloud or on-premises. Application gateway has the following application delivery features: HTTP load balancing, cookie-based session affinity, and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) offload, custom health probes, and support for multi-site.

## Prerequisite: Install the Azure CLI
To perform the steps in this article, you need to [install the Azure Command-Line Interface for Mac, Linux, and Windows (Azure CLI)](../xplat-cli-install.md) and you need to [log on to Azure](../xplat-cli-connect.md).

## Scenario
In this scenario, you learn how to create an application gateway using the Azure portal.

This scenario will:

* Create a medium application gateway with two instances.
* Create a virtual network named AdatumAppGatewayVNET with a reserved CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16.
* Create a subnet called Appgatewaysubnet that uses 10.0.0.0/28 as its CIDR block.
* Configure a certificate for SSL offload.

![Scenario example][scenario]

> [!NOTE]
> Additional configuration of the application gateway, including custom health probes, backend pool addresses, and additional rules are configured after the application gateway is configured and not during initial deployment.

## Before you begin
Azure Application Gateway requires its own subnet. When creating a virtual network, ensure that you leave enough address space to have multiple subnets. Once you deploy an application gateway to a subnet,
only additional application gateways are able to be added to the subnet.

## Create the resource group
Before creating the application gateway, a resource group is created to contain the application gateway. The following shows the command.

    azure group create -n AdatumAppGatewayRG -l eastus

## Create a virtual network
Once the resource group is created, a virtual network is created for the application gateway.  In the following example, the address space was as 10.0.0.0/16 as defined in the preceding scenario notes.

    azure network vnet create -n AdatumAppGatewayVNET -a 10.0.0.0/16 -g AdatumAppGatewayRG -l eastus

## Create a subnet
After the virtual network is created, a subnet is added for the application gateway.  If you plan to use application gateway with a web app hosted in the same virtual network as the application gateway, be sure to leave enough room for another subnet.

    azure network vnet subnet create -g AdatumAppGatewayRG -n Appgatewaysubnet -v AdatumAppGatewayVNET -a 10.0.0.0/28 

## Create the application gateway
Once the virtual network and subnet are created, the pre-requisites for the application gateway are complete. Additionally a previously exported .pfx certificate and the password for the certificate are required for the following step. 
The IP addresses used for the backend are the IP addresses for your backend server. These values can be either private IPs in the virtual network, public ips, or fully qualified domain names for your backend servers.

    azure network application-gateway create -n AdatumAppGateway -l eastus -g AdatumAppGatewayRG -e AdatumAppGatewayVNET -m Appgatewaysubnet -r 134.170.185.46,134.170.188.221,134.170.185.50 -y c:\AdatumAppGateway\adatumcert.pfx -x P@ssw0rd

This example creates a basic application gateway with default settings for the listener, backend pool, backend http settings, and rules. It also configures SSL offload. You can modify these settings to suit your deployment once the provisioning is successful.
If you already have your web application defined with the IP addresses for the backend pool defined in the preceding steps, once the application gateway is provisioned and started load balancing begins.
