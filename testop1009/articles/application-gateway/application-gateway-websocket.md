# Application Gateway WebSocket support
WebSocket protocol standardized in [RFC6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) enables a full duplex communication between server and client over a long running TCP connection. This allows for a more interactive communication between web server and client, which can be bidirectional without the need for polling as required in HTTP-based implementations.  WebSocket have low overhead unlike HTTP and can reuse the same TCP connection for multiple request/responses resulting in a more efficient utilization of resources. WebSocket protocols are designed to work over traditional HTTP ports of 80 and 443.

Application Gateway provides native support for WebSocket across all gateway sizes. There is no user-configurable setting to selectively enable or disable WebSocket support. You can continue using a standard HTTPListener on port 80/443 to receive WebSocket traffic. WebSocket traffic is then directed to the WebSocket enabled backend server using the appropriate backend pool as specified in application gateway rules. 

The backend server must respond to application gateway probes, which are described in [health probe overview](application-gateway-probe-overview.md) section.  Application gateway health probes are HTTP/HTTPS only and this implies that every backend server must respond to HTTP probes for application gateway to be able to route WebSocket traffic to the server.

## Listener configuration element
Existing HTTPListener can be used to support WebSocket. Following is a snippet of HttpListeners element from a sample template file. You would need both HTTP and HTTPS listeners to support WebSocket and secure WebSocket traffic. Similarly you can use [portal](application-gateway-create-gateway-portal.md) or [powershell](application-gateway-create-gateway-arm.md) to create an application gateway with listeners on port 80/443 to support WebSocket traffic.

         "httpListeners": [
                    {
                        "name": "appGatewayHttpsListener",
                        "properties": {
                            "FrontendIPConfiguration": {
                                "Id": "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/applicationGateway1/frontendIPConfigurations/DefaultFrontendPublicIP"
                            },
                            "FrontendPort": {
                                "Id": "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/applicationGateway1/frontendPorts/appGatewayFrontendPort443'"
                            },
                            "Protocol": "Https",
                            "SslCertificate": {
                                "Id": "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/applicationGateway1/sslCertificates/appGatewaySslCert1'"
                            },
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "appGatewayHttpListener",
                        "properties": {
                            "FrontendIPConfiguration": {
                                "Id": "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/applicationGateway1/frontendIPConfigurations/appGatewayFrontendIP'"
                            },
                            "FrontendPort": {
                                "Id": "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/applicationGateway1/frontendPorts/appGatewayFrontendPort80'"
                            },
                            "Protocol": "Http",
                        }
                    }
                ],

## BackendAddressPool, BackendHttpSetting, and Routing rule configuration
BackendAddressPool should be used to define a backend pool with WebSocket enabled servers. BackendHttpSetting should be defined with backend port 80/443 only. Properties for cookie-based affinity and requestTimeouts are not relevant to WebSocket traffic. There is no change required in routing rule. Routing rule 'Basic' should continue to be used to tie the appropriate listener to the corresponding backend address pool. 

    "requestRoutingRules": [{
        "name": "<ruleName1>",
        "properties": {
            "RuleType": "Basic",
            "httpListener": {
                "id": "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/applicationGateway1/httpListeners/appGatewayHttpsListener')]"
            },
            "backendAddressPool": {
                "id": "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/applicationGateway1/backendAddressPools/ContosoServerPool')]"
            },
            "backendHttpSettings": {
                "id": "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/applicationGateway1/backendHttpSettingsCollection/appGatewayBackendHttpSettings')]"
            }
        }

    }, {
        "name": "<ruleName2>",
        "properties": {
            "RuleType": "Basic",
            "httpListener": {
                "id": "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/applicationGateway1/httpListeners/appGatewayHttpListener')]"
            },
            "backendAddressPool": {
                "id": "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/applicationGateway1/backendAddressPools/ContosoServerPool')]"
            },
            "backendHttpSettings": {
                "id": "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/applicationGateway1/backendHttpSettingsCollection/appGatewayBackendHttpSettings')]"
            }

        }
    }]

## WebSocket enabled backend
Your backend must have a HTTP/HTTPS web server running on the configured port (usually 80/443) for WebSocket to work. This is because WebSocket protocol requires the initial handshake to be HTTP with Upgrade to WebSocket protocol as a header field. 

    GET /chat HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com
    Upgrade: websocket
    Connection: Upgrade
    Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
    Origin: http://example.com
    Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat
    Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13

Another reason for this is that application gateway backend health probe supports HTTP/HTTPS protocols only. If the backend server does not respond to HTTP/HTTPS probes, it would be taken out of backend pool and no requests including WebSocket requests, would be able to reach this backend. 

## Next steps
After learning about WebSocket support, go to [create an application gateway](application-gateway-create-gateway.md) to get started with a WebSocket enabled web application.
