# Create an application gateway for hosting multiple web applications
Multiple site hosting allows you to deploy more than one web application on the same application gateway. It relies on presence of host header in incoming HTTP request, to determine which listener would receive traffic. The listener then directs traffic to appropriate backend pool as configured in rules definition of the gateway. In case of SSL enabled web applications, application gateway relies on Server Name Indication (SNI) extension to choose the correct listener for the web traffic.

A common use for multiple site hosting is to load balance requests for different web domains to different back-end server pools. Similarly multiple sub-domains of the same root domain could also be hosted on the same application gateway.

## Scenario
In the following example, application gateway is serving traffic for contoso.com and fabrikam.com with two back-end server pools: contoso server pool and fabrikam server pool. Similar setup could be used to host sub-domains like app.contoso.com and blog.contoso.com.

## Before you begin
1. Install the latest version of the Azure PowerShell cmdlets by using the Web Platform Installer. You can download and install the latest version from the **Windows PowerShell** section of the [Downloads page](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/).
2. You will create a virtual network and subnet for application gateway. Make sure that no virtual machines or cloud deployments are using the subnet. The application gateway must be by itself in a virtual network subnet.
3. The servers added to the back-end pool to use the application gateway must exist or have their endpoints created either in the virtual network or with a public IP/VIP assigned.

## What is required to create an application gateway?
* **Back-end server pool:** The list of IP addresses of the back-end servers. The IP addresses listed should either belong to the virtual network subnet or should be a public IP/VIP. FQDN can also be used.
* **Back-end server pool settings:** Every pool has settings like port, protocol, and cookie-based affinity. These settings are tied to a pool and are applied to all servers within the pool.
* **Front-end port:** This port is the public port that is opened on the application gateway. Traffic hits this port, and then gets redirected to one of the back-end servers.
* **Listener:** The listener has a front-end port, a protocol (Http or Https, these are case-sensitive), and the SSL certificate name (if configuring SSL offload). For multi-site enabled application gateways, host name and SNI indicators are also added.
* **Rule:** The rule binds the listener, the back-end server pool and defines which back-end server pool the traffic should be directed to when it hits a particular listener.

## Create a new application gateway
Here are the steps that are needed to create an application gateway:

1. Create a resource group for Resource Manager.
2. Create a virtual network, subnet, and public IP for the application gateway.
3. Create an application gateway configuration object.
4. Create an application gateway resource.

## Create a resource group for Resource Manager
Make sure that you are using the latest version of Azure PowerShell. More info is available at [Using Windows PowerShell with Resource Manager](../powershell-azure-resource-manager.md).

### Step 1
Login to Azure 
        Login-AzureRmAccount

You will be prompted to authenticate with your credentials.<BR>

### Step 2
Check the subscriptions for the account.

        Get-AzureRmSubscription

### Step 3
Choose which of your Azure subscriptions to use. <BR>

        Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "Name of subscription"

### Step 4
Create a new resource group (skip this step if you're using an existing resource group).

    New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name appgw-RG -location "East Asia"
Alternatively you can also create tags for a resource group for application gateway:

    $resourceGroup = New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name appgw-RG -Location "East Asia" -Tags @{Name = "testtag"; Value = "Application Gateway multiple site"} 

Azure Resource Manager requires that all resource groups specify a location. This is used as the default location for resources in that resource group. Make sure that all commands to create an application gateway will use the same resource group.

In the example above, we created a resource group called "appgw-RG" and location "East Asia".

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to configure a custom probe for your application gateway, see [Create an application gateway with custom probes by using PowerShell](application-gateway-create-probe-ps.md). Check out [custom probes and health monitoring](application-gateway-probe-overview.md) for more information.

## Create a virtual network and a subnet for the application gateway
The following example shows how to create a virtual network by using Resource Manager.

### Step 1
Assign the address range 10.0.0.0/24 to the subnet variable to be used to create a virtual network.

    $subnet = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name subnet01 -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/24


### Step 2
Create a virtual network named "appgwvnet" in resource group "appgw-rg" for the West US region using the prefix 10.0.0.0/16 with subnet 10.0.0.0/24.

    $vnet = New-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -Name appgwvnet -ResourceGroupName appgw-RG -Location "East Asia" -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16 -Subnet $subnet


### Step 3
Assign a subnet variable for the next steps, which creates an application gateway.

    $subnet=Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name subnet01 -VirtualNetwork $vnet

## Create a public IP address for the front-end configuration
Create a public IP resource "publicIP01" in resource group "appgw-rg" for the West US region.

    $publicip = New-AzureRmPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroupName appgw-RG -name publicIP01 -location "East Asia" -AllocationMethod Dynamic

An IP address will be assigned to the application gateway when the service starts.

## Create application gateway configuration
You need to set up all configuration items before creating the application gateway. The following steps create the configuration items that are needed for an application gateway resource.

### Step 1
Create an application gateway IP configuration named "gatewayIP01". When application gateway starts, it will pick up an IP address from the subnet configured and route network traffic to the IP addresses in the back-end IP pool. Keep in mind that each instance will take one IP address.

    $gipconfig = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayIPConfiguration -Name gatewayIP01 -Subnet $subnet


### Step 2
Configure the back-end IP address pool named "pool01"and "pool2" with IP addresses "10.0.0.100, 10.0.0.101,10.0.0.102" for "pool1" and "10.0.0.103, 10.0.0.104, 10.0.0.105" for "pool2".

    $pool1 = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayBackendAddressPool -Name pool01 -BackendIPAddresses 10.0.0.100, 10.0.0.101,10.0.0.102 
    $pool2 = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayBackendAddressPool -Name pool02 -BackendIPAddresses 10.0.0.103, 10.0.0.104, 10.0.0.105

In this example there will be two back-end pools to route network traffic based on the reqested site. One pool receives traffic from site "contoso.com" and other pool will receive traffic from site "fabrikam.com". You have to replace the IP addresses above to add your own application IP address endpoints. Please note that in place of internal IP addresses, you could also use public IP addresses, FQDN or a VM's NIC for backend instances. Use "-BackendFQDNs" parameter in PowerShell to specify FQDNs instead of IPs.

### Step 3
Configure application gateway setting "poolsetting01" and "poolsetting02" for the load-balanced network traffic in the back-end pool. In this example you configure different back-end pool settings for the back-end pools. Each back-end pool can have its own back-end pool setting.

    $poolSetting01 = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayBackendHttpSettings -Name "besetting01" -Port 80 -Protocol Http -CookieBasedAffinity Disabled -RequestTimeout 120
    $poolSetting02 = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayBackendHttpSettings -Name "besetting02" -Port 80 -Protocol Http -CookieBasedAffinity Enabled -RequestTimeout 240

### Step 4
Configure the front-end IP with public IP endpoint.

    $fipconfig01 = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayFrontendIPConfig -Name "frontend1" -PublicIPAddress $publicip

### Step 5
Configure the front-end port for an application gateway.

    $fp01 = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayFrontendPort -Name "fep01" -Port 443

### Step 6
Configure two SSL certificates for the two websites we are going to support in this example. One certificate is for contoso.com traffic and the other is for fabrikam.com traffic. These should be a Certificate Authority issued certificates for your websites. Self-signed certificates are supported but not recommended for production traffic.

    $cert01 = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewaySslCertificate -Name  contosocert -CertificateFile <file path> -Password <password>
    $cert02 = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewaySslCertificate -Name fabrikamcert -CertificateFile <file path> -Password <password>


### Step 7
Configure two listeners for the two web sites in this example. This step configures the listeners for public IP address, port and host used to receive incoming traffic. HostName parameter is required for multiple site support and should be set to the appropriate website for which the traffic will be received. RequireServerNameIndication parameter should be set to true for websites which need support for SSL in multiple host scenario. If SSL support is required you will also need to specify the SSL certificate which will be used to secure traffic for that web application. The combination of FrontendIPConfiguration, FrontendPort and HostName must be unique to a listener. Each listener can support one certificate.

    $listener01 = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayHttpListener -Name "listener01" -Protocol Https -FrontendIPConfiguration $fipconfig01 -FrontendPort $fp01 -HostName "contoso11.com" -RequireServerNameIndication true  -SslCertificate $cert01
    $listener02 = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayHttpListener -Name "listener02" -Protocol Https -FrontendIPConfiguration $fipconfig01 -FrontendPort $fp01 -HostName "fabrikam11.com" -RequireServerNameIndication true -SslCertificate $cert02


### Step 8
Create two rule setting for the two web applications in this example. A rule ties together listeners, backend pools and http settings. This step configures the application gateway to use Basic routing rule, one for each website. Traffic to each website is received by its configured listener, and is then directed to its configured backend pool, using the properties specified in the BackendHttpSettings.

    $rule01 = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayRequestRoutingRule -Name "rule01" -RuleType Basic -HttpListener $listener01 -BackendHttpSettings $poolSetting01 -BackendAddressPool $pool1
    $rule02 = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewayRequestRoutingRule -Name "rule02" -RuleType Basic -HttpListener $listener02 -BackendHttpSettings $poolSetting02 -BackendAddressPool $pool2

### Step 9
Configure the number of instances and size for the application gateway.

    $sku = New-AzureRmApplicationGatewaySku -Name "Standard_Medium" -Tier Standard -Capacity 2

## Create application gateway
Create an application gateway with all configuration objects from the steps above.

    $appgw = New-AzureRmApplicationGateway -Name appgwtest -ResourceGroupName appgw-RG -Location "East Asia" -BackendAddressPools $pool1,$pool2 -BackendHttpSettingsCollection $poolSetting01, $poolSetting02 -FrontendIpConfigurations $fipconfig01 -GatewayIpConfigurations $gipconfig -FrontendPorts $fp01 -HttpListeners $listener01, $listener02 -RequestRoutingRules $rule01, $rule02 -Sku $sku -SslCertificates $cert01, $cert02     


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Application Gateway provisioning is a long running operation and may take some time to complete.

## Get application gateway DNS name
Retrieve details of the application gateway and its associated IP/DNS name using the PublicIPAddress element attached to the application gateway. The application gateway's DNS name should be used to create a CNAME record which points the two web applications to this DNS name. The use of A-records is not recommended since the VIP may change on restart of application gateway.

    Get-AzureRmPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroupName appgw-RG -name publicIP01

    Name                     : publicIP01
    ResourceGroupName        : appgw-RG
    Location                 : eastasia
