In Media Services, you upload your digital files into an asset. The Asset  can contain video, audio, images, thumbnail collections, text tracks and closed caption files (and the metadata about these files.) Once the files are uploaded, your content is stored securely in the cloud for further processing and streaming.

1. In the **Setting** window, click **Assets**.
   
    ![Upload files](./media/media-services-portal-vod-get-started/media-services-upload.png)
2. Click the **Upload** button.
   
    The **Upload a video asset** window appears.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > There is no file size limitation.
   > 
   > 
3. Browse to the desired video on your computer, select it, and hit OK.  
   
    The upload starts and you can see the progress under the file name.  

Once the upload completes, you will see the new asset listed in the **Assets** window. 

## Next steps
You can now encode your uploaded assets. For more information, see [Encode assets](media-services-portal-encode.md).
