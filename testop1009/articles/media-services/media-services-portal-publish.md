# Publish content with the Azure portal

## Overview
> [!NOTE]
> To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

To provide your user with a  URL that can be used to stream or download your content, you first need to "publish" your asset by creating a locator. Locators provide access to files contained in the asset. Media Services supports two types of locators: 

* Streaming (OnDemandOrigin) locators, used for adaptive streaming (for example, to stream MPEG DASH, HLS, or Smooth Streaming). To create a streaming locator your asset must contain an .ism file. 
* Progressive (SAS) locators, used for delivery of video via progressive download.

A streaming URL has the following format and you can use it to play Smooth Streaming assets.

    {streaming endpoint name-media services account name}.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/{locator ID}/{filename}.ism/Manifest

To build an HLS streaming URL, append (format=m3u8-aapl) to the URL.

    {streaming endpoint name-media services account name}.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/{locator ID}/{filename}.ism/Manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)

To build an  MPEG DASH streaming URL, append (format=mpd-time-csf) to the URL.

    {streaming endpoint name-media services account name}.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/{locator ID}/{filename}.ism/Manifest(format=mpd-time-csf)

A SAS URL has the following format.

    {blob container name}/{asset name}/{file name}/{SAS signature}

For more information, see [Delivering content overview](media-services-deliver-content-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you used the portal to create locators before March 2015, locators with a two year expiration date were created.  
> 
> 

To update an expiration date on a locator, use [REST](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh974308.aspx#update_a_locator) or [.NET](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=533259) APIs. Note that when you update the expiration date of a SAS locator, the URL changes.

### To use the portal to publish an asset
To use the portal to publish an asset, do the following:

1. Log in at the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Select **Settings** > **Assets**.
3. Select the asset that you want to publish.
4. Click the **Publish** button.
5. Select the locator type.
6. Press **Add**.
   
    ![Publish](./media/media-services-portal-vod-get-started/media-services-publish1.png)

The URL will be added to the list of **Published URLs**.

## Play content from the portal
The Azure portal provides a content player that you can use to test your video.

Click the desired video and then click the **Play** button.

![Publish](./media/media-services-portal-vod-get-started/media-services-play.png)

Some considerations apply:

* Make sure the video has been published.
* This **Media player** plays from the default streaming endpoint. If you want to play from a non-default streaming endpoint, click to copy the URL and use another player. For example, [Azure Media Services Player](http://amsplayer.azurewebsites.net/azuremediaplayer.html).
* The streaming endpoint from which you are streaming must be running.  
* To stream from a streaming endpoint, you should add at least one streaming unit. For more information, see [this](media-services-portal-scale-streaming-endpoints.md) topic.
