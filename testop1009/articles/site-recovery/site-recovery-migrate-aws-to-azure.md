# Migrate Windows virtual machines in Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Azure with Azure Site Recovery
## Overview
Welcome to Azure Site Recovery. Use this article to migrate Windows instances running in AWS to Azure with Site Recovery. Before you start, note that:

* Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources: Azure Resource Manager and classic. Azure also has two portals â€“ the Azure classic portal that supports the classic deployment model, and the Azure portal with support for both deployment models. The basic steps for migration are the same whether you're configuring Site Recovery in Resource Manager or in classic.However the UI instructions and screenshots in this article are relevant for the Azure portal.
* **Currently you can only migrate from AWS to Azure. You can fail over VMs from AWS to Azure, but you can't fail them back again. There's no ongoing replication.**
* The migration instructions in this article are based on the instructions for replicating a physical machine to Azure. It includes links to the steps in [Replicate VMware VMs or physical servers to Azure](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure.md), which describes how to replicate a physical server in the Azure portal.
* If you're setting up Site Recovery in the classic portal, follow the detailed instructions in [this article](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic.md). **You should no longer use** the instructions in this [legacy article](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic-legacy.md).

## Prerequisites
Here's what you need for this deployment

* **Configuration server**: An on-premises VM running Windows Server 2012 R2 that acts as the configuration server. You install the other Site Recovery components (including the process server and master target server) on this VM too. Read more in [scenario architecture](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure.md#scenario-architecture) and [configuration server prerequisites](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure.md#configuration-server-prerequisites).
* **EC2 VM instances**: The instances running Windows you want to migrate.

## Deployment steps
This section describes the deployment steps in the new Azure portal. If you need these deployment steps for Site Recovery in the classic portal, refer to [this article](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic.md).

1. [Create a vault](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure.md#create-a-recovery-services-vault).
2. [Deploy a configuration server](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure.md#step-2-set-up-the-source-environment).
3. After you've deployed the configuration server, validate that it can communicate with the VMs that you want to migrate.
4. [Set up replication settings](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure.md#step-4-set-up-replication-settings). Create a replication policy and assign to the configuration server.
5. [Install the Mobility service](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure.md#step-6-replication-application). Each VM you want to protect needs the Mobility service installed. This service sends data to the process server. The Mobility service can be installed manually or pushed and installed automatically by the process server when protection for the VM is enabled. Firewall rules on EC2 instances that you want to migrate should be configured to allow push installation of this service. The security group for EC2 instances should have the following rules:
   
    ![firewall rules](./media/site-recovery-migrate-aws-to-azure/migrate-firewall.png)
6. [Enable replication](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure.md#enable-replication). Enable replication for the VMs you want to migrate. You can discover the EC2 instances using the private IP addresses, which you can get from the EC2 console.
7. [ Run an unplanned failover](site-recovery-failover.md#run-an-unplanned-failover). After initial replication is complete, you can run an unplanned failover from AWS to Azure for each VM. Optionally, you can create a recovery plan and run an unplanned failover, to migrate multiple virtual machines from AWS to Azure. [Learn more](site-recovery-create-recovery-plans.md) about recovery plans.
