# IoT Hub SDKs
This article provides information about the various [Microsoft Azure IoT SDKs][Microsoft Azure IoT SDKs] along with links to additional resources.

## IoT Hub device SDKs
The Microsoft Azure IoT device SDKs contain code that facilitates building devices and applications that connect to and are managed by Azure IoT Hub services.

The following IoT device SDKs are available to download from GitHub:

* [Azure IoT device SDK for C][Azure IoT device SDK for C] written in ANSI C (C99) for portability and broad platform compatibility.
* [Azure IoT device SDK for .NET][Azure IoT device SDK for .NET]
* [Azure IoT device SDK for Java][Azure IoT device SDK for Java]
* [Azure IoT device SDK for Node.js][Azure IoT device SDK for Node.js]
* [Microsoft Azure IoT device SDK for Python 2.7][Microsoft Azure IoT device SDK for Python 2.7]

### OS Platforms and hardware compatibility
For more information about compatibility with specific hardware devices, see the following articles:

* [OS Platforms and hardware compatibility with device SDKs][OS Platforms and hardware compatibility]
* [Microsoft Azure Certified for IoT program][Microsoft Azure Certified for IoT program].

## IoT Hub service SDKs
The Microsoft Azure IoT service SDKs contain code that facilitates building applications that interact directly with IoT Hub to manage devices and security.

The following IoT service SDKs are available to download from GitHub:

* [Azure IoT service SDK for Node.js][Azure IoT service SDK for Node.js]
* [Azure IoT service SDK for Java][Azure IoT service SDK for Java]

## Azure IoT Gateway SDK
This Azure IoT Gateway SDK contains the infrastructure and modules to create IoT gateway solutions. You can extend the SDK to create gateways tailored to any end-to-end scenario.

You can download the [Azure IoT Gateway SDK][Azure IoT Gateway SDK] from GitHub.

## Online API reference documentation
The following is a list of links to online API reference documentation for Azure IoT device, service, and gateway libraries:
