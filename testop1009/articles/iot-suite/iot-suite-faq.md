# Frequently asked questions for IoT Suite
### What's the difference between deleting a resource group in the Azure portal and clicking delete on a preconfigured solution in azureiotsuite.com?
* If you delete the preconfigured solution in [azureiotsuite.com][lnk-azureiotsuite], you delete all the resources that were provisioned when you created the preconfigured solution; if you added additional resources to the resource group, these are also deleted. 
* If you delete the resource group in the [Azure portal][lnk-azure-portal], you only delete the resources in that resource group; you will also need to delete the Azure Active Directory application associated with the preconfigured solution in the [Azure classic portal][lnk-classic-portal].

### How many IoT Hub instances can I provision in a subscription?
Ten. You can create an [Azure support ticket][link-azuresupportticket] to raise this limit, but by default, you can only provision ten IoT Hubs per subscription, as outlined in [Azure subscription limits][link-azuresublimits]. As a result, since every preconfigured solution provisions a new IoT Hub, you can only provision up to ten preconfigured solutions in a given subscription. 

### How many DocumentDB instances can I provision in a subscription?
Fifty. You can create an [Azure support ticket][link-azuresupportticket] to raise this limit, but by default, you can only provision fifty DocumentDB instances per subscription. 

### How many Free Bing Maps APIs can I provision in a subscription?
Two. You can create only two Internal Transactions Level 1 Bing Maps for Enterprise plans in an Azure subscription. The remote monitoring solution is provisioned by default with the Internal Transactions Level 1 plan. As a result, you can only provision up to two remote monitoring solutions in a subscription with no modifications.

### I have a remote monitoring solution deployment with a static map, how do I add an interactive Bing map?
1. Get your Bing Maps API for Enterprise QueryKey from [Azure portal][lnk-azure-portal]: 
   
   1. Navigate to the Resource Group where your Bing Maps API for Enterprise is in the [Azure portal][lnk-azure-portal].
   2. Click All Settings, then Key Management. 
   3. You'll notice two keys: MasterKey and QueryKey. Copy the value for QueryKey.
      
      > [!NOTE]
      > Don't have a Bing Maps API for Enterprise account? Create one in the [Azure portal][lnk-azure-portal] by clicking + New, searching for Bing Maps API for Enterprise and follow prompts to create.
      > 
      > 
2. Pull down the latest code from the [Azure-IoT-Remote-Monitoring][lnk-remote-monitoring-github].
3. Run a local or cloud deployment following commandline deployment guidance in the /docs/ folder in the repository. 
4. After you've run a local or cloud deployment, look in your root folder for the *.user.config file created during deployment. Open this file in a text editor. 
5. Change the following line to include the value you copied fror your QueryKey: 
   
   `<setting name="MapApiQueryKey" value="" />`

### Can I create a preconfigured solution if I have Microsoft Azure for DreamSpark?
At this time, you cannot create a preconfigured solution with a [Microsoft Azure for DreamSpark][lnk-dreamspark] account. However, you can create a [free trial account for Azure][lnk-30daytrial] in just a couple of minutes that will enable you create a preconfigured solution.

### How do I delete an AAD tenant?
See Eric Golpe's blog post [Walkthrough of Deleting an Azure AD Tenant][lnk-delete-aad-tennant].
