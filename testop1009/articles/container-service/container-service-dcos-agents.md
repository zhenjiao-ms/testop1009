# DC/OS Agent Pools for Azure Container Service
DC/OS Azure Container Service divides agents into public or private pools. A deployment can be made to either pool, affecting accessibility between machines in your container service. The machines can be exposed to the internet (public) or kept internal (private). This article gives a brief overview of why there are a public and private pool.

### Private agents
Private agent nodes run through a non-routable network. This network is only accessible from the admin zone or through the public zone edge router. By default, DC/OS launches apps on private agent nodes. Consult the [DC/OS documentation](https://dcos.io/docs/1.7/administration/securing-your-cluster/) for more information about network security.

### Public agents
Public agent nodes run DC/OS apps and services through a publicly accessible network. Consult the [DC/OS documentation](https://dcos.io/docs/1.7/administration/securing-your-cluster/) for more information about network security.

## Using agent pools
By default, **Marathon** deploys any new application to the *private* agent nodes. You have to explicitly deploy the application to the *public* node during the creation of the application. Select the **Optional** tab and enter **slave_public** for the **Accepted Resource Roles** value. This process is documented [here](container-service-mesos-marathon-ui.md#deploy-a-docker-formatted-container) and in the [DC\OS](https://dcos.io/docs/1.7/administration/installing/custom/create-public-agent/) documentation.

Learn how to [open the firewall](container-service-enable-public-access.md) provided by Azure to allow public access to your DC/OS container.
