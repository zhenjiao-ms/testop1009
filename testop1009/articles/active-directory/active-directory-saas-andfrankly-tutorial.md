# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with &frankly
The objective of this tutorial is to show you how to integrate &frankly with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating &frankly with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to &frankly
* You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to &frankly (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure classic portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis.md).

## Prerequisites
To configure Azure AD integration with &frankly, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription
* A &frankly single-sign on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.
> 
> 

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

* You should not use your production environment, unless this is necessary.
* If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
The objective of this tutorial is to enable you to test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding &frankly from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding &frankly from the gallery
To configure the integration of &frankly into Azure AD, you need to add &frankly from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add &frankly from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **Azure classic Portal**, on the left navigation pane, click **Active Directory**. 
   
    ![Active Directory][1]
2. From the **Directory** list, select the directory for which you want to enable directory integration.
3. To open the applications view, in the directory view, click **Applications** in the top menu.
   
    ![Applications][2]
4. Click **Add** at the bottom of the page.
   
    ![Applications][3]
5. On the **What do you want to do** dialog, click **Add an application from the gallery**.
   
    ![Applications][4]
6. In the search box, type **&frankly**.
   
    ![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/active-directory-saas-andfrankly-tutorial/tutorial_andfrankly_01.png)
7. In the results panel, select **&frankly**, and then click **Complete** to add the application.
   
    ![Selecting the app in the gallery](./media/active-directory-saas-andfrankly-tutorial/tutorial_andfrankly_0001.png)

## Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
The objective of this section is to show you how to configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with &frankly based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in &frankly to an user in Azure AD is. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in &frankly needs to be established.

This link relationship is established by assigning the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** in &frankly.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with &frankly, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a &frankly test user](#creating-a-&frankly-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in &frankly that is linked to the Azure AD representation of her.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on
