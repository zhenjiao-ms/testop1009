# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with ClickTime
In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate ClickTime with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating ClickTime with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to ClickTime
* You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to ClickTime (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure classic portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis.md).

## Prerequisites
To configure Azure AD integration with ClickTime, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription
* A ClickTime single-sign on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.
> 
> 

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

* You should not use your production environment, unless this is necessary.
* If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding ClickTime from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding ClickTime from the gallery
The objective of this section is to outline how to enable the application integration for ClickTime.

### To enable the application integration for ClickTime, perform the following steps:
1. In the Azure classic portal, on the left navigation pane, click **Active Directory**.
   
   ![Active Directory](./media/active-directory-saas-clicktime-tutorial/tic700993.png "Active Directory")
2. From the **Directory** list, select the directory for which you want to enable directory integration.
3. To open the applications view, in the directory view, click **Applications** in the top menu.
   
   ![Applications](./media/active-directory-saas-clicktime-tutorial/tic700994.png "Applications")
4. Click **Add** at the bottom of the page.
   
   ![Add application](./media/active-directory-saas-clicktime-tutorial/tic749321.png "Add application")
5. On the **What do you want to do** dialog, click **Add an application from the gallery**.
   
   ![Add an application from gallerry](./media/active-directory-saas-clicktime-tutorial/tic749322.png "Add an application from gallerry")
6. In the **search box**, type **ClickTime**.
   
   ![Application gallery](./media/active-directory-saas-clicktime-tutorial/tic777275.png "Application gallery")
7. In the results pane, select **ClickTime**, and then click **Complete** to add the application.
   
   ![ClickTime](./media/active-directory-saas-clicktime-tutorial/tic777276.png "ClickTime")

## Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with ClickTime based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in ClickTime is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in ClickTime needs to be established.

This link relationship is established by assigning the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** in ClickTime.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with ClickTime, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a ClickTime test user](#creating-a-clicktime-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in ClickTime that is linked to the Azure AD representation of her.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on
The objective of this section is to outline how to enable users to authenticate to ClickTime with their account in Azure AD using federation based on the SAML protocol.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to be able to configure single sign-on on your ClickTime tenant, you need to contact first the ClickTime technical support to get this feature enabled.
> 
> 

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with ClickTime, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure classic portal, on the **ClickTime** application integration page, click **Configure single sign-on** to open the **Configure Single Sign On** dialog.
   
   ![Enable single sign-on](./media/active-directory-saas-clicktime-tutorial/tic777277.png "Enable single sign-on")
2. On the **How would you like users to sign on to ClickTime** page, select **Microsoft Azure AD Single Sign-On**, and then click **Next**.
   
   ![Configure single sign-on](./media/active-directory-saas-clicktime-tutorial/tic777278.png "Configure single sign-on")
3. On the **Configure App Settings** dialog page, perform the following steps:
   
    ![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/active-directory-saas-clicktime-tutorial/tic777286.png) 
   
    a. In the **IdentifierL** textbox, type the URL using the following pattern: **https://app.clicktime.com/sp/**
   
    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type the URL using the following pattern: **https://app.clicktime.com/Login/**
