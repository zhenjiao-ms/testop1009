# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with SuccessFactors
The objective of this tutorial is to show you how to integrate SuccessFactors with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating SuccessFactors with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to SuccessFactors
* You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to SuccessFactors (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure classic portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis.md).

## Prerequisites
To configure Azure AD integration with SuccessFactors, you need the following items:

* A valid Azure subscription
* A tenant in SuccessFactors

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.
> 
> 

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

* You should not use your production environment, unless this is necessary.
* If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
The objective of this tutorial is to enable you to test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding SuccessFactors from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding SuccessFactors from the gallery
To configure the integration of SuccessFactors into Azure AD, you need to add SuccessFactors from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add SuccessFactors from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure classic portal, on the left navigation panel, click **Active Directory**.
   
   ![Configuring single sign-on][1]
2. From the **Directory** list, select the directory for which you want to enable directory integration.
3. To open the applications view, in the directory view, click **Applications** in the top menu.
   
   ![Configuring single sign-on][2]
4. Click **Add** at the bottom of the page.
   
   ![Applications][3]
5. On the **What do you want to do** dialog, click **Add an application from the gallery**.
   
   ![Configuring single sign-on][4]
6. In the **search box**, type **SuccessFactors**.
   
   ![Configuring single sign-on][5]
7. In the results panel, select **SuccessFactors**, and then click **Complete** to add the application.
   
   ![Configuring single sign-on][6]

## Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
The objective of this section is to show you how to configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SuccessFactors based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in SuccessFactors to an user in Azure AD is. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in SuccessFactors needs to be established.

This link relationship is established by assigning the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** in SuccessFactors.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SuccessFactors, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a SuccessFactors test user](#creating-a-successfactors-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in SuccessFactors that is linked to the Azure AD representation of her.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the classic portal and configure single sign-on in your SuccessFactors application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with SuccessFactors, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure classic portal, on the **SuccessFactors** application integration page, click **Configure single sign-on** to open the **Configure Single Sign On** dialog.
   
   ![Configuring single sign-on][7]
2. On the **How would you like users to sign on to SuccessFactors** page, select **Microsoft Azure AD Single Sign-On**, and then click **Next**.
   
   ![Configuring single sign-on][8]
3. On the **Configure App URL** page, perform the following steps, and then click **Next**.
   
   ![Configuring single sign-on][9]
   
   a. In the **Sign On URL** textbox, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

   | `https://<company name>.successfactors.eu/<company name>` |
   | `https://<company name>.sapsf.eu` |
   
   b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using one of the following patterns: 
   
   |  |
   | --- |
   | `https://<company name>.successfactors.com/<company name>` |
   | `https://<company name>.sapsf.com/<company name>` |
   | `https://<company name>.successfactors.eu/<company name>` |
   | `https://<company name>.sapsf.eu` |
   | `https://<company name>.sapsf.eu/<company name>` |
   
   c. Click **Next**. 

    > [AZURE.TIP] Please note that these are not the real values. You have to update these values with the actual Sign On URL and Reply URL. To get these values, contact [SuccessFactors support team](https://www.successfactors.com/en_us/support.html).

1. On the **Configure single sign-on at SuccessFactors** page, click **Download certificate**, and then save the certificate file locally on your computer.
