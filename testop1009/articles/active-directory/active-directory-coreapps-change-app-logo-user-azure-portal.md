# Change the name or logo of an enterprise app in Azure Active Directory preview
It's easy to change the name or logo for a custom enterprise application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) preview. [What's in the preview?](active-directory-preview-explainer.md) You must have the appropriate permissions to make these changes. In the current preview, you must be the creator of the custom app.

## How do I change an enterprise app's name or logo?
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that's a global admin for the directory.
2. Select **More services**, enter **Azure Active Directory** in the text box, and then select **Enter**.
3. On the **Azure Active Directory - *directoryname*** blade (that is, the Azure AD blade for the directory you are managing), select **Enterprise applications**.

5. On the **Enterprise applications - All applications** blade, select an app.
6. On the ***appname*** blade (that is, the blade with the name of the selected app in the title), select **Properties**.
