# View all the enterprise apps that I can manage in Azure Active Directory preview
You can manage your enterprise applications in the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) preview. [What's in the preview?](active-directory-preview-explainer.md) This includes viewing the apps you can manage, assigning users or groups to an app, maintaining properties for the app such as the application name/logo, and even disabling an application so that no users can sign in to it.

## How do I view all my apps?
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that's a global admin for the directory.
2. Select **More services**, enter **Azure Active Directory** in the text box, and then select **Enter**.
3. On the **Azure Active Directory -** ***directoryname*** blade (that is, the Azure AD blade for the directory you are managing), select **Enterprise applications**.

4. On the **Enterprise applications** blade, select **All applications**. From this blade you can select apps to manage, change the displayed columns, or filter the list to find that app you want (for example, to view only disabled apps).
