# Troubleshooting: You can't get there from here
You got an access denied page when you accessed an application like SharePoint Online.  
Now, what do you do?

This guide helps you identify available remediation steps that you can follow to gain access to the application.

What device platform is your device running on?
The answer to this question determines the right section in this topic for you:

* Windows device
* iOS device (iPhone or iPad)
* Android device

## Access from a Windows device
If your device runs Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8.0, Windows 7, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2008 R2, choose the appropriate cause by identifying the page that you got when you tried to access the application.

### Device is not registered
If your device is not registered with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and the application is protected with a device-based policy, you might see a page with the following content:

!["You can't get there from here" messages for unregistered devices](./media/active-directory-conditional-access-device-remediation/01.png "Scenario")

If your device is domain-joined to Active Directory in your organization, you can try the following:

1. Make sure that you have signed in to Windows by using your work account (Active Directory account).
2. Connect to your corporate network via VPN or DirectAccess.
3. After you are connected, lock your Windows session by using the Windows key + L key.
4. Unlock your Windows session by entering your work account credentials.
5. Wait for a minute, and then try to access the application again.
6. If you get the same page, contact your administrator, click the **More details** link, and then provide the details.

If your device is not domain-joined and runs Windows 10, you have two options:

* Run Azure AD Join.
* Add your work or school account to Windows.

For information about the differences between the two, see [Using Windows 10 devices in your workplace](active-directory-azureadjoin-windows10-devices.md).

To run Azure AD Join, do the following (not available for Windows Phone):

**Windows 10 Anniversary Update**

1. Open the **Settings** app.
2. Click **Accounts** > **Access work or school**.
3. Click **Connect**.
4. Click **Join this device to Azure AD** at the bottom of the page.
5. Authenticate to your organization, provide multi-factor authentication proof, if needed, and then follow the steps until completion.
6. Sign out, and then sign in by using your work account.
7. Try to access the application again.

**Windows 10 November 2015 Update**

1. Open the **Settings** app.
2. Click **System** > **About**.
3. Click **Join Azure AD**.
4. Authenticate to your organization, provide multi-factor authentication proof, if needed, and then follow the steps until completion.
5. Sign out, and then sign in by using your work account (Azure AD account).
6. Try to access the application again.

To add your work or school account, do the following:

**Windows 10 Anniversary Update**

1. Open the **Settings** app.
2. Click **Accounts** > **Access work or school**.
3. Click **Connect**.
4. Authenticate to your organization, provide multi-factor authentication proof, if needed, and then follow the steps until completion.
5. Try to access the application again.

**Windows 10 November 2015 Update**

1. Open the **Settings** app.
2. Click **Accounts** > **Your accounts**.
3. Click **Add work or school account**.
4. Authenticate to your organization, provide multi-factor authentication proof, if needed, and then follow the steps until completion.
5. Try to access the application again.

If your device is not domain-joined and runs Windows 8.1, you can do Workplace Join and enroll in Microsoft Intune by doing the following:

1. Open **PC Settings**.
2. Click **Network** > **Workplace**.
3. Click **Join**.
4. Authenticate to your organization, provide multi-factor authentication proof, if needed, and then follow the steps until completion.
5. Click **Turn on**.
6. Wait until completion.
7. Try to access the application again.

## Unsupported browser
If you are accessing the application from the following browsers, you will see a page that's similar to the page shown previously:

* Chrome, Firefox, or any other browser that is not Microsoft Edge or Microsoft Internet Explorer in Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016.
* Firefox in Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2008 R2.

!["You can't get there from here" message for unsupported browsers](./media/active-directory-conditional-access-device-remediation/02.png "Scenario")

The only remediation is to use a browser that the application supports for your device platform.
