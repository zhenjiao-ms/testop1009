# Add language-specific company branding to your sign-in page in the Azure Active Directory preview
To avoid confusion, many companies want to apply a consistent look and feel across all the websites and services they manage. Azure Active Directory preview provides this capability by allowing you to customize the appearance of the sign-in page with your company logo and custom color schemes. [What's in the preview?](active-directory-preview-explainer.md) The sign-in page is the page that appears when you sign in to Office 365 or other web-based applications that are using Azure AD as your identity provider. You interact with this page to enter your credentials.

## Customizing the sign-in page for another language
You can add language-specific elements to your custom sign-in page only if you have already created a custom sign-in page as described in [Add company branding to your sign-in page](active-directory-branding-custom-signon-azure-portal.md). You can configure one sign-in page per directory with a default set of customizable elements. After youâ€™ve configured the default set of page elements, you can configure more versions for different locales. You can also mix and match various elements. For example, you could:

* Create a default **Sign-in page image** that works for all cultures, then create specific versions for English and French. When you set your browsers to one of these two languages, the language-specific image appears, while the default illustration appears for all other languages.
* Configure different logos for your organization (for example, Japanese or Hebrew versions).

We recommend that you keep the number of language variations low, for maintenance and performance reasons.

**To add company branding to your directory:**

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that's a global admin for the directory.
2. Select **More services**, enter **Users and groups** in the text box, and then select **Enter**.

3. On the **Users and groups** blade, select **Company branding**.
4. On the **Users and groups - Company branding** blade, select the **Add language** command.

5. Modify the elements you want to customize. All elements are optional.
6. Click **Save**.

It can take up to an hour for any changes you made to the sign-in page branding to appear.
