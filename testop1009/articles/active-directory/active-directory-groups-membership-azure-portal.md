# Manage the groups your group is a member of in Azure Active Directory preview
Groups can contain other groups in Azure Active Directory preview. [What's in the preview?](active-directory-preview-explainer.md) Here's how to manage those memberships.

## How do I find the groups my group is a member of?
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that's a global admin for the directory.
2. Select **More services**, enter **Users and groups** in the text box, and then select **Enter**.

3. On the **Users and groups** blade, select **All groups**.

4. On the **Users and groups - All groups** blade, select a group.
5. On the **Group - *groupname*** blade, select **Group memberships**.

6. To add your group as a member of another group, on the **Group - Group memberships** blade, select the **Add** command.
7. Select a group from the **Select Group** blade, and then select the **Select** button at the bottom of the blade. You can add your group to only one group at a time. The **User** box filters the display based on matching your entry to any part of a user or device name. No wildcard characters are accepted in that box.
