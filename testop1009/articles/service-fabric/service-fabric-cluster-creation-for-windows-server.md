# Create and manage a cluster running on Windows Server
Azure Service Fabric allows the creation of Service Fabric clusters on any virtual machines or computers running Windows Server. This means you can deploy and run Service Fabric applications in any environment that contains a set of interconnected Windows Server computers, be it on-premises or with any cloud provider. Service Fabric provides a setup package to create Service Fabric clusters called the standalone Windows Server package.

This article walks you through the steps for creating a cluster using the standalone package for Service Fabric on-premises, though it can be easily adapted for any other environment such as other cloud providers.

> [!NOTE]
> This standalone Windows Server package is currently in preview and is not supported for production workloads. [Click here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=733084) if you would like to download a copy of the EULA now.

## Plan and prepare your cluster deployment
The following steps need to be performed before you create your cluster.

### Step 1: Plan your cluster infrastructure
You are about to create a Service Fabric cluster on machines you own, so you can decide what kinds of failures you want the cluster to survive. For example, do you need separate power lines or Internet connections supplied to these machines? In addition, consider the physical security of these machines.  Where is the physical location and who needs access to them?  Once you make these decisions, you can logically map the machines to the various fault domains (see below for more information). The infrastructure planning for production clusters will be more involved than the test clusters.

### Step 2: Prepare the machines to meet the prerequisites
Prerequisites for each machine that you want to add to the cluster:

* Minimum of 2 GB memory is recommended
* Network connectivity: Make sure that the machines are on a secure network or networks.
* Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2012 (you need to have [KB2858668](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2858668) installed for this).
* [.NET Framework 4.5.1 or higher](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=40773), full install.
* [Windows PowerShell 3.0](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-windows-powershell).
* The cluster administrator deploying and configuring the cluster must have [administrator privileges](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/13436.windows-server-2012-how-to-add-an-account-to-a-local-administrator-group.aspx) on each of the machines.
* The [RemoteRegistry service](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc754820) should be running on all the machines.

### Step 3: Determine the initial cluster size
Each node in a standalone Service Fabric cluster, has the Service Fabric runtime deployed and is a member of the cluster. In a typical production deployment there is one node per OS instance (physical or virtual). The cluster size is determined by your business needs; however, you must have a minimum cluster size of three nodes (machines/VMs).
Note that for development purposes, you can have more than one node on a given machine. In a production environment, Service Fabric supports only one node per physical or virtual machine.

### Step 4: Determine the number of fault domains and upgrade domains
A **Fault Domain (FD)** is a physical unit of failure and is directly related to the physical infrastructure in the data centers. A fault domain consists of hardware components (computers, switches, network and more) that share a single point of failure. Although there is no 1:1 mapping between fault domains and racks, loosely speaking, each rack can be considered a fault domain. When considering the nodes in your cluster, we strongly recommend that the nodes be distributed amongst at least three fault domains.

When you specify FDs in the *ClusterConfig.json*, you can choose the name for each FD. Service Fabric supports hierarchical FDs, so you can reflect your infrastructure topology in them.  For example, the following FDs are valid:

* "faultDomain": "fd:/Room1/Rack1/Machine1"
* "faultDomain": "fd:/FD1"
* "faultDomain": "fd:/Room1/Rack1/PDU1/M1"

An **Upgrade Domain (UD)** is a logical unit of nodes. During a Service Fabric orchestrated upgrades (either an application upgrade or a cluster upgrade), all nodes in a UD are taken down to perform the upgrade while nodes in other UDs remain available to serve requests. The firmware upgrades you do to your machines will not honor UDs, so you must do them one machine at a time.

The simplest way to think about these concepts is to consider FDs as the unit of unplanned failure, and UDs as the unit of planned maintenance.

When you specify UDs in the *ClusterConfig.json*, you can choose the name for each UD. For example, the following are valid:

* "upgradeDomain": "UD0"
* "upgradeDomain": "UD1A"
* "upgradeDomain": "DomainRed"
* "upgradeDomain": "Blue"

For more detailed information on upgrade domains and fault domain read the [Describing a Service Fabric cluster](service-fabric-cluster-resource-manager-cluster-description.md) article.

### Step 5: Download the Service Fabric standalone package  for Windows Server
[Download the Service Fabric standalone package for Windows Server](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=730690) and unzip the package, either to a deployment machine that is not part of the cluster, or to one of the machines that will be part of your cluster.

## Create your cluster
After you have gone through steps outlined in the planning and preparation section above, you are ready to create your cluster.

### Step 1: Modify cluster configuration
The cluster is described in a *ClusterConfig.json* file. For details on the sections in this file read the [Configuration settings for standalone Windows cluster](service-fabric-cluster-manifest.md) article.
Open one of the *ClusterConfig.json* files from the package you downloaded and modify the following settings:

| **Configuration Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **NodeTypes** |Node types allow you to separate your cluster nodes into various groups. A cluster must have at least one NodeType. All nodes in a group have the following common characteristics. <br> **Name** - This is the node type name. <br>**Endpoint Ports** - These are various named end points (ports) that are associated with this node type. You can use any port number that you wish, as long as they do not conflict with anything else in this manifest and are not already in use by any other application running on the machine/VM. <br> **Placement Properties** - These describe properties for this node type that you will use as placement constraints for the system services or your services. These properties are user defined key/value pairs that provide extra meta data for a given node. Examples of node properties would be whether or not the node has a hard drive or graphics card, the number of spindles in its hard drive, cores and other physical properties. <br> **Capacities** - Node capacities define the name and amount of a particular resource that a particular node has available for consumption. For example, a node may define that it has capacity for a metric called “MemoryInMb” and that it has 2048 MB available by default. These capacities are used at runtime to ensure that services which require particular amounts of resources are placed on the nodes that have those resources available in the required amounts.<br>**IsPrimary** - If you have more than one NodeType defined ensure that only one is set to primary with the value *true*, which is where the system services run. All other node types should be set to the value *false* |
| **Nodes** |These are the details for each of the nodes that are part of the cluster (node type, node name, IP address, fault domain and upgrade domain of the node). The machines you want the cluster to be created on need to be listed here with their IP addresses. <br> If you use the same IP address for all the nodes, then a one-box cluster is created, which you can use for testing purposes. One-box clusters should not be used for deploying production workloads. |

### Step 2: Run the create cluster script
Once you have modified the cluster configuration in the JSON doc and added all the node information to it, run the cluster creation *CreateServiceFabricCluster.ps1* PowerShell script from the package folder and pass in the path to the JSON configuration file and the location of the package CAB file.

This script can be run on any machine that has administrator access to all the machines that are listed as nodes in the cluster configuration file. The machine that this script is run on may or may not be part of the cluster.

```
#Create an unsecured local development cluster

.\CreateServiceFabricCluster.ps1 -ClusterConfigFilePath .\ClusterConfig.Unsecure.DevCluster.json -MicrosoftServiceFabricCabFilePath .\MicrosoftAzureServiceFabric.cab -AcceptEULA $true
```
```
#Create an unsecured multi-machine cluster

.\CreateServiceFabricCluster.ps1 -ClusterConfigFilePath .\ClusterConfig.Unsecure.MultiMachine.json -MicrosoftServiceFabricCabFilePath .\MicrosoftAzureServiceFabric.cab -AcceptEULA $true
```

> [!NOTE]
> The deployment logs are available locally on the VM/Machine that you ran the CreateServiceFabricCluster Powershell on. You will find them in a sub-folder called "DeploymentTraces" in the folder where you ran the Powershell command. Also to see whether Service Fabric was deployed correctly to a machine, you can find the installed files in the C:\ProgramData directory and the FabricHost.exe and Fabric.exe processes can be seen running in Task Manager.

### Step 3: Connect to the Cluster
Now you can connect to the cluster with Service Fabric Explorer either directly from one of the machines with http://localhost:19080/Explorer/index.html or remotely with http://<*IPAddressofaMachine*>:19080/Explorer/index.html

## Add and remove nodes to your cluster
You can add or remove nodes to your standalone Service Fabric cluster as your business needs change. Read [Add or Remove nodes to a Service Fabric standalone cluster](service-fabric-cluster-windows-server-add-remove-nodes.md) for detailed steps.

## Remove your cluster
To remove a cluster run the *RemoveServiceFabricCluster.ps1* Powershell script from the package folder and pass in the path to the JSON configuration file and the location of the package CAB file.

This script can be run on any machine that has administrator access to all the machines that are listed as nodes in the cluster configuration file. The machine that this script is run on may or may not be part of the cluster

```
.\RemoveServiceFabricCluster.ps1 -ClusterConfigFilePath .\ClusterConfig.Unsecure.MultiMachine.json   -MicrosoftServiceFabricCabFilePath .\MicrosoftAzureServiceFabric.cab
```
