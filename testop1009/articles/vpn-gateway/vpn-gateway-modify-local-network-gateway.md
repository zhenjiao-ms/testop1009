# Modify local network gateway settings using PowerShell
Sometimes the settings for your local network gateway AddressPrefix or GatewayIPAddress change. The instructions below will help you modify your local network gateway settings. You can also modify these settings in the Azure portal.

## Before you begin
You'll need to install the latest version of the Azure Resource Manager PowerShell cmdlets. See [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md) for more information about installing the PowerShell cmdlets.

## To modify IP address prefixes
[!INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-modify-ip-prefix-rm](../../includes/vpn-gateway-modify-ip-prefix-rm-include.md)]

## To modify the gateway IP address
[!INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-modify-lng-gateway-ip-rm](../../includes/vpn-gateway-modify-lng-gateway-ip-rm-include.md)]

## Next steps
You can verify your gateway connection. See [Verify a gateway connection](vpn-gateway-verify-connection-resource-manager.md).
