# Working with self-signed certificates for Point-to-Site connections
This article helps you create a self-signed certificate using **makecert**, and then generate client certificates from it. The steps are written for makecert on Windows 10. Makecert has been validated to create certificates that are compatible with P2S connections. 

For P2S connections, the preferred method for certificates is to use your enterprise certificate solution, making sure to issue the client certificates with the common name value format 'name@yourdomain.com', rather than the 'NetBIOS domain name\username' format.

If you don't have an enterprise solution, a self-signed certificate is necessary to allow P2S clients to connect to a virtual network. We are aware that makecert has been deprecated, but it is still a valid method for creating self-signed certificates that are compatible with P2S connections. We're working on another solution for creating self-signed certificates, but at this time, makecert is the preferred method.

## Create a self-signed certificate
Makecert is one way of creating a self-signed certificate. The following steps walk you through creating a self-signed certificate using makecert. These steps are not deployment-model specific. They are valid for both Resource Manager and classic.

### To create a self-signed certificate
1. From a computer running Windows 10, download and install the [Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 10](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/downloads/windows-10-sdk).
2. After installation, you can find the makecert.exe utility under this path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\<arch>. 
   
    Example: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x64`
3. Next, create and install a certificate in the Personal certificate store on your computer. The following example creates a corresponding *.cer* file that you upload to Azure when configuring P2S. Run the following command, as administrator. Replace  *ARMP2SRootCert* and *ARMP2SRootCert.cer* with the name that you want to use for the certificate.<br><br>The certificate will be located in your Certificates - Current User\Personal\Certificates.
   
        makecert -sky exchange -r -n "CN=ARMP2SRootCert" -pe -a sha1 -len 2048 -ss My "ARMP2SRootCert.cer"

### <a name="rootpublickey"></a>To obtain the public key
As part of the VPN Gateway configuration for Point-to-Site connections, the public key for the root certificate is uploaded to Azure.

1. To obtain a .cer file from the certificate, open **certmgr.msc**. Right-click the self-signed root certificate, click **all tasks**, and then click **export**. This opens the **Certificate Export Wizard**.
2. In the Wizard, click **Next**, select **No, do not export the private key**, and then click **Next**.
3. On the **Export File Format** page, select **Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER).** Then, click **Next**. 
4. On the **File to Export**, **Browse** to the location to which you want to export the certificate. For **File name**, name the certificate file. Then click **Next**.
5. Click **Finish** to export the certificate.

### Export the self-signed certificate (optional)
You may want to export the self-signed certificate and store it safely. If need be, you can later install it on another computer and generate more client certificates, or export another .cer file. Any computer with a client certificate installed and that is also configured with the proper VPN client settings can connect to your virtual network via P2S. For that reason, you want to make sure that client certificates are generated and installed only when needed and that the self-signed certificate is stored safely.

To export the self-signed certificate as a .pfx, select the root certificate and use the same steps as described in [Export a client certificate](#clientkey) to export.

## Create and install client certificates
You don't install the self-signed certificate directly on the client computer. You need to generate a client certificate from the self-signed certificate. You then export and install the client certificate to the client computer. The following steps are not deployment-model specific. They are valid for both Resource Manager and classic.

### Part 1 - Generate a client certificate from a self-signed certificate
The following steps walk you through one way to generate a client certificate from a self-signed certificate. You may generate multiple client certificates from the same certificate. Each client certificate can then be exported and installed on the client computer. 

1. On the same computer that you used to create the self-signed certificate, open a command prompt as administrator.
2. In this example, "ARMP2SRootCert" refers to the self-signed certificate that you generated. 
   
   * Change *"ARMP2SRootCert"* to the name of the self-signed root that you are generating the client certificate from. 
   * Change *ClientCertificateName* to the name you want to generate a client certificate to be. 

    Modify and run the sample to generate a client certificate. If you run the following example without modifying it, the result is a client certificate named ClientCertificateName in your Personal certificate store that was generated from root certificate ARMP2SRootCert.

        makecert.exe -n "CN=ClientCertificateName" -pe -sky exchange -m 96 -ss My -in "ARMP2SRootCert" -is my -a sha1

1. All certificates are stored in your 'Certificates - Current User\Personal\Certificates' store on your computer. You can generate as many client certificates as needed based on this procedure.

### <a name="clientkey"></a>Part 2 - Export a client certificate
1. To export a client certificate, open **certmgr.msc**. Right-click the client certificate that you want to export, click **all tasks**, and then click **export**. This opens the **Certificate Export Wizard**.
2. In the Wizard, click **Next**, then select **Yes, export the private key**, and then click **Next**.
3. On the **Export File Format** page, you can leave the defaults selected. Then click **Next**. 
4. On the **Security** page, you must protect the private key. If you select to use a password, make sure to record or remember the password that you set for this certificate. Then click **Next**.
5. On the **File to Export**, **Browse** to the location to which you want to export the certificate. For **File name**, name the certificate file. Then click **Next**.
6. Click **Finish** to export the certificate.    

### Part 3 - Install a client certificate
Each client that you want to connect to your virtual network by using a Point-to-Site connection must have a client certificate installed. This certificate is in addition to the required VPN configuration package. The following steps walk you through installing the client certificate manually.

1. Locate and copy the *.pfx* file to the client computer. On the client computer, double-click the *.pfx* file to install. Leave the **Store Location** as **Current User**, then click **Next**.
2. On the **File** to import page, don't make any changes. Click **Next**.
3. On the **Private key protection** page, input the password for the certificate if you used one, or verify that the security principal that is installing the certificate is correct, then click **Next**.
4. On the **Certificate Store** page, leave the default location, and then click **Next**.
5. Click **Finish**. On the **Security Warning** for the certificate installation, click **Yes**. The certificate is now successfully imported.

## Next steps
Continue with your Point-to-Site configuration.
