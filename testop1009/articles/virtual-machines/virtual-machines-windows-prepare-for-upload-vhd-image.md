# Prepare a Windows VHD to upload to Azure
To upload a Windows VM from on-premises to Azure, you must correctly prepare the virtual hard disk (VHD). There are several recommended steps for you to complete before you upload a VHD to Azure. Running `sysprep` is a common process, but only one step in generalizing an image. This article shows you how to prepare a Windows VHD to upload to Microsoft Azure.

## Prepare the virtual disk
> [!NOTE]
> The newer VHDX format is not supported in Azure. The VHD must be a Fixed size, not Dynamic. If needed, the instructions below detail converting from VHDX or Dynamic disks. The maximum size allowed for the VHD is 1,023 GB.
> 
> 

Make sure that the Windows VHD is working correctly on the local server. Resolve any errors within the VM itself before trying to convert or upload to Azure.

If you need to convert your virtual disk to the required format for Azure, use one of the methods noted in the following sections. Back up the VM before running any virtual disk conversion process or Sysprep.

### Convert using Hyper-V Manager
* Open Hyper-V Manager and select your local computer on the left. In the menu above it, click **Action** > **Edit Disk**.
  
  * On the **Locate Virtual Hard Disk** screen, browse to, and select your virtual disk.
  * Select **Convert** on the next screen
    
    * If you need to convert from VHDX, select **VHD** and click **Next**
    * If you need to convert from Dynamic disk, select **Fixed size** and click **Next**
  * Browse to and select **Path for the new VHD file**.
  * Click **Finish** to close.

### Convert using PowerShell
You can convert a virtual disk using the [Convert-VHD PowerShell cmdlet](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh848454.aspx). In the following example, we are converting from a VHDX to VHD, and converting from a Dynamic to Fixed type:

```powershell
Convert-VHD –Path c:\test\MY-VM.vhdx –DestinationPath c:\test\MY-NEW-VM.vhd -VHDType Fixed
```

### Convert from VMware VMDK disk format
If you have a Windows VM image in the [VMDK file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMDK), convert it to a VHD by using the [Microsoft Virtual Machine Converter](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=42497). Read the blog [How to Convert a VMware VMDK to Hyper-V VHD](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/timomta/archive/2015/06/11/how-to-convert-a-vmware-vmdk-to-hyper-v-vhd.aspx) for more information.

## Prepare Windows configuration for upload
> [!NOTE]
> Run all the following commands with [administrative privileges](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc947813.aspx).
> 
> 

1. Remove any static persistent route on the routing table:
   
   * To view the route table, run `route print`.
   * Check the **Persistence Routes** sections. If there is a persistent route, use [route delete](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc739598.apx) to remove it.
2. Remove the WinHTTP proxy:
   
    ```
    netsh winhttp reset proxy
    ```
3. Configure the disk SAN policy to [Onlineall](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg252636.aspx):
   
    ```
    diskpart san policy=onlineall
    ```
4. Use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time for Windows and set the startup type of the Windows Time (w32time) service to **Automatically**:
   
    ```
    REG ADD HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation /v RealTimeIsUniversal /t REG_DWORD /d 1
    sc config w32time start= auto
    ```

## Configure Windows services
1. Make sure that each of the following Windows services is set to the **Windows default values**. They are configured with the startup settings noted in the following list. You can run these commands to reset the startup settings:
   
    ```
    sc config bfe start= auto
   
    sc config dcomlaunch start= auto
   
    sc config dhcp start= auto
   
    sc config dnscache start= auto
   
    sc config IKEEXT start= auto
   
    sc config iphlpsvc start= auto
   
    sc config PolicyAgent start= demand
   
    sc config LSM start= auto
   
    sc config netlogon start= demand
   
    sc config netman start= demand
   
    sc config NcaSvc start= demand
   
    sc config netprofm start= demand
   
    sc config NlaSvc start= auto
   
    sc config nsi start= auto
   
    sc config RpcSs start= auto
   
    sc config RpcEptMapper start= auto
   
    sc config termService start= demand
   
    sc config MpsSvc start= auto
   
    sc config WinHttpAutoProxySvc start= demand
   
    sc config LanmanWorkstation start= auto
   
    sc config RemoteRegistry start= auto
    ```

## Configure Remote Desktop configuration
1. If there are any self-signed certificates tied to the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) listener, remove them:
   
    ```
    REG DELETE "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp\SSLCertificateSHA1Hash”
    ```
   
    For more information about configuring certificates for RDP listener, see [Listener Certificate Configurations in Windows Server ](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askperf/2014/05/28/listener-certificate-configurations-in-windows-server-2012-2012-r2/)
2. Configure the [KeepAlive](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc957549.aspx) values for RDP service:
   
    ```
    REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services" /v KeepAliveEnable /t REG_DWORD  /d 1 /f
   
    REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services" /v KeepAliveInterval /t REG_DWORD  /d 1 /f
   
    REG ADD "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\Winstations\RDP-Tcp" /v KeepAliveTimeout /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
    ```
3. Configure the authentication mode for the RDP service:
   
    ```
    REG ADD "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp" /v UserAuthentication /t REG_DWORD  /d 1 /f
   
    REG ADD "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp" /v SecurityLayer /t REG_DWORD  /d 1 /f
   
    REG ADD "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp" /v fAllowSecProtocolNegotiation /t REG_DWORD  /d 1 /f
    ```
4. Enable RDP service by adding the following subkeys to the registry:
   
    ```
    REG ADD "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD  /d 0 /f
    ```

## Configure Windows Firewall rules
1. Allow WinRM through the three firewall profiles (Domain, Private and Public) and enable PowerShell Remote service:
   
   ```
   Enable-PSRemoting -force
   ```
2. Make sure that the following guest operating system firewall rules are in place:
   
   * Inbound
   
   ```
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=in name="File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=in name="Network Discovery (LLMNR-UDP-In)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=in name="Network Discovery (NB-Datagram-In)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=in name="Network Discovery (NB-Name-In)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=in name="Network Discovery (Pub-WSD-In)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=in name="Network Discovery (SSDP-In)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=in name="Network Discovery (UPnP-In)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=in name="Network Discovery (WSD EventsSecure-In)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=in name="Windows Remote Management (HTTP-In)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=in name="Windows Remote Management (HTTP-In)" new enable=yes
   ```
   
   * Inbound and outbound
   
   ```
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="Remote Desktop" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="Core Networking" new enable=yes
   ```
   
   * Outbound
   
   ```
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=out name="Network Discovery (LLMNR-UDP-Out)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=out name="Network Discovery (NB-Datagram-Out)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=out name="Network Discovery (NB-Name-Out)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=out name="Network Discovery (Pub-WSD-Out)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=out name="Network Discovery (SSDP-Out)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=out name="Network Discovery (UPnPHost-Out)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=out name="Network Discovery (UPnP-Out)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=out name="Network Discovery (WSD Events-Out)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=out name="Network Discovery (WSD EventsSecure-Out)" new enable=yes
   
   netsh advfirewall firewall set rule dir=out name="Network Discovery (WSD-Out)" new enable=yes
   ```

## Additional Windows configuration steps
1. Run `winmgmt /verifyrepository` to confirm that the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) repository is consistent. If the repository is corrupted, see [this blog post](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askperf/2014/08/08/wmi-repository-corruption-or-not).
2. Make sure the Boot Configuration Data (BCD) settings match the following:
   
   ```
   bcdedit /set {bootmgr} integrityservices enable
   
   bcdedit /set {default} device partition=C:
   
   bcdedit /set {default} integrityservices enable
   
   bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled Off
   
   bcdedit /set {default} osdevice partition=C:
   
   bcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy IgnoreAllFailures
   ```
3. Remove any extra Transport Driver Interface filters, such as software that analyzes TCP packets.
4. To make sure the disk is healthy and consistent, run the `CHKDSK /f` command.
5. Uninstall all other third-party software and drivers.
6. Make sure that a third-party application is not using Port 3389. This port is used for the RDP service in Azure.
7. If the Windows VHD that you want to upload is a domain controller, follow [these extra steps](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2904015) to prepare the disk.
8. Reboot the VM to make sure that Windows is still healthy can be reached by using the RDP connection.
9. Reset the current local administrator password and make sure that you can use this account to sign in to Windows through the RDP connection.  This access permission is controlled by the "Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services" policy object. This object is located under "Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment."

2. If you want to create an image to deploy multiple machines from it, you need to generalize the image by running `sysprep` before you upload the VHD to Azure. For more information about how to create a generalized image, see the following articles:
   
   * [Create a VM image from an existing Azure VM using the Resource Manager deployment model](virtual-machines-windows-capture-image.md)
   * [Create a VM image from an existing Azure VM using the Classic deployment modem](virtual-machines-windows-classic-capture-image.md)
   * [Sysprep Support for Server Roles](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/commercialize/manufacture/desktop/sysprep-support-for-server-roles)

## Suggested extra configurations
The following settings do not affect VHD uploading. However, we strongly recommend that you have them configured.

* Install the [Azure Virtual Machines Agent](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394789&clcid=0x409). After you install the agent, you can enable VM extensions. The VM extensions implement most of the critical functionality that you want to use with your VMs like resetting passwords, configuring RDP, and many others.
* The Dump log can be helpful in troubleshooting Windows crash issues. Enable the Dump log collection:
  
    ```
    REG ADD "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\CrashControl" /v CrashDumpEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`
  
    REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps" /v DumpFolder /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "c:\CrashDumps" /f
  
    REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps" /v DumpCount /t REG_DWORD /d 10 /f
  
    REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps" /v DumpType /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f
  
    sc config wer start= auto
    ```
* After the VM is created in Azure, configure the system defined size pagefile on drive D:
  
    ```
    REG ADD "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management" /t REG_MULTI_SZ /v PagingFiles /d "D:\pagefile.sys 0 0" /f
    ```
