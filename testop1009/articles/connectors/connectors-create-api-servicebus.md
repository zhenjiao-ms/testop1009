# Get started with the Azure Service Bus connector
Connect to Azure Service Bus to send and receive messages. You can perform actions such as send to queue, send to topic, receive from queue, and receive from subscription.

To use [any connector](apis-list.md), you first need to create a logic app. You can get started by [creating a logic app now](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Connect to Service Bus
Before your logic app can access any service, you first need to create a connection to the service. A [connection](connectors-overview.md) provides connectivity between a logic app and another service.

## Use a Service Bus trigger
A trigger is an event that can be used to start the workflow defined in a logic app. [Learn more about triggers](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps.md#logic-app-concepts).

## Use a Service Bus action
An action is an operation carried out by the workflow defined in a logic app. [Learn more about actions](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps.md#logic-app-concepts).
