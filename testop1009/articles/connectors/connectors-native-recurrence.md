# Get started with the recurrence trigger
By using the recurrence trigger, you can create powerful workflows in the cloud.

For example, you can:

* Schedule a workflow to run a SQL stored procedure every day.
* Email a summary of all tweets within the last week about a certain hashtag.

To get started using the recurrence trigger in a logic app, see [Create a logic app](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Use a recurrence trigger
A trigger is an event that can be used to start the workflow that is defined in a logic app. [Learn more about triggers](connectors-overview.md).

Hereâ€™s an example sequence of how to set up a recurrence trigger in a logic app:

1. Add the **Recurrence** trigger as the first step in a logic app.
2. Fill in the parameters for the recurrence interval.

The logic app now starts a run after each interval of time.

## Trigger details
The recurrence trigger has the following properties that you can configure.

It fires a logic app after a specified time interval.
A * means that it is a required field.

| Display name | Property name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frequency* |frequency |The unit of time: `Second`, `Minute`, `Hour`, `Day`, or `Year`. |
| Interval* |interval |The interval of the given frequency for the recurrence. |
| Time Zone |timeZone |If a start time is provided without a UTC offset, this time zone will be used. |
| Start time |startTime |The start time in [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations). |
