In this article you'll find an overview of the backup management tasks available through the Azure management portal and the Microsoft Azure Backup agent.

[!INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-rm-include.md)] classic deployment model.

## Management portal tasks
### Access your Recovery Services vaults
1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using your Azure subscription.
2. On the Hub menu, click **Browse** and in the list of resources, type **Recovery Services**. As you begin typing, the list will filter based on your input. Click **Recovery Services vaults**.
   
    ![Create Recovery Services Vault step 1](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/browse-to-rs-vaults.png) <br/>
3. Select the name of the vault you want to view from the list to open the Recovery Services vault dashboard blade.
   
    ![recovery services vault dashboard](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/rs-vault-dashboard.png) <br/>

## Monitor jobs and alerts
You monitor jobs and alerts from the Recovery Services vault dashboard, where you see:

* Backup alerts details
* Files and folders, as well as Azure virtual machines protected in cloud
* Total storage consumed in Azure
* Backup job status

![Backup dashboard tasks](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/dashboard-tiles.png)

Clicking the information in each of these tiles will open the associated blade where you manage    related tasks.

From the top of the Dashboard:

* Settings provides access available backup tasks.
* Backup - helps you back up new files and folders (or Azure VMs) to the Recovery Services vault.
* Delete - If a recovery services vault is no longer being used, you can delete it to free up storage space. Delete is only enabled after all protected servers have been deleted from the vault.

![Backup dashboard tasks](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/dashboard-tasks.png)

## Manage Backup alerts
Click the **Backup Alerts** tile to open the **Backup Alerts** blade and manage alerts.

![Backup alerts](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/manage-backup-alerts.png)

The Backup Alerts tile shows you the number of:

* critical alerts unresolved in last 24 hours
* warning alerts unresolved in last 24 hours

Clicking on each of these links takes you to the **Backup Alerts** blade with a filtered view of these alerts (critical or warning).

From the Backup Alerts blade, you:

* Choose the appropriate information to include with your alerts.
  
    ![Choose colunms](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/choose-alerts-colunms.png)
* Filter alerts for severity, status and start/end times.
  
    ![Filter alerts](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/filter-alerts.png)
* Configure notifications for severity, frequency and recipients, as well as turn alerts on or off.
  
    ![Filter alerts](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/configure-notifications.png)

If **Per Alert** is selected as the **Notify** frequency no grouping or reduction in emails occurs. Every alert results in 1 notification. This is the default setting and the resolution email is also sent out immediately.

If **Hourly Digest** is selected as the **Notify** frequency one email is sent to the user telling them that there are unresolved new alerts generated in the last hour. A resolution email is sent out at the end of the hour.

Alerts can be sent for the following severity levels:

* critical
* warning
* information

You inactivate the alert with the **inactivate** button in the job details blade. When you click inactivate, you can provide resolution notes.

You choose the columns you want to appear as part of the alert with the **Choose columns** button.

> [!NOTE]
> From the **Settings** blade, you manage backup alerts by selecting **Monitoring and Reports > Alerts and Events > Backup Alerts** and then clicking **Filter** or **Configure Notifications**.
> 
> 

## Manage Backup items
Managing on-premises backups is now available in the management portal. In the Backup section of the dashboard, the **Backup Items** tile shows the number of backup items protected to the vault.

Click **File-Folders** in the Backup Items tile.

![Backup items tile](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/backup-items-tile.png)

The Backup Items blade opens with the filter set to File-Folder where you see each specific backup item listed.

![Backup items](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/backup-item-list.png)

If you click a specific backup items from the list, you see the essential details for that item.

> [!NOTE]
> From the **Settings** blade, you manage files and folders by selecting **Protected Items > Backup Items** and then selecting **File-Folders** from the drop down menu.
> 
> 

![Backup items from settings](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/backup-files-and-folders.png)

## Manage Backup jobs
Backup jobs for both on-premises (when the on-premises server is backing up to Azure) and Azure backups are visible in the dashboard.

In the Backup section of the dashboard, the Backup job tile shows the number of jobs:

* in progress
* failed in the last 24 hours.

To manage your backup jobs, click the **Backup Jobs** tile, which opens the Backup Jobs blade.

![Backup items from settings](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/backup-jobs.png)

You modify the information available in the Backup Jobs blade with the **Choose columns** button at the top of the page.

Use the **Filter** button to select between Files and folders and Azure virtual machine backup.

If you don't see your backed up files and folders, click **Filter** button at the top of the page and select **Files and folders** from the Item Type menu.

> [!NOTE]
> From the **Settings** blade, you manage backup jobs by selecting **Monitoring and Reports > Jobs > Backup Jobs** and then selecting **File-Folders** from the drop down menu.
> 
> 

## Monitor Backup usage
In the Backup section of the dashboard, the Backup Usage tile show the storage consumed in Azure. Storage usage is provided for:

* Cloud LRS storage usage associated with the vault
* Cloud GRS storage usage associated with the vault

## Production servers
To manage your production servers, click **Settings**. Under Manage click **Backup infrastructure > Production Servers**.

The Production Servers blade lists of all your available production servers. Click on a server in the list to open the server details.

## Microsoft Azure Backup agent tasks
## Open the backup agent
Open the **Microsoft Azure Backup agent** (you find it by searching your machine for *Microsoft Azure Backup*).

![Schedule a Windows Server Backup](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/snap-in-search.png)

From the **Actions** available at the right of the backup agent console you perform the following management tasks:

* Register Server
* Schedule Backup
* Back Up now
* Change Properties

![Microsoft Azure Backup agent console actions](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/console-actions.png)

> [!NOTE]
> To **Recover Data**, see [Restore files to a Windows server or Windows client machine](backup-azure-restore-windows-server.md).

    After modifying protection, you can confirm that backups are triggering correctly by going to the **Jobs** tab and confirming that changes are reflected in the backup jobs.

## Enable Network Throttling
The Azure Backup agent provides a Throttling tab which allows you to control how network bandwidth is used during data transfer. This control can be helpful if you need to back up data during work hours but do not want the backup process to interfere with other internet traffic. Throttling of data transfer applies to back up and restore activities.  

To enable throttling:

1. In the **Backup agent**, click **Change Properties**.
2. Select the **Enable internet bandwidth usage throttling for backup operations** checktile.
   
    ![Network throttling](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/throttling-dialog.png)
3. Once you have enabled throttling, specify the allowed bandwidth for backup data transfer during **Work hours** and **Non-work hours**.
   
    The bandwidth values begin at 512 kilobytes per second (Kbps) and can go up to 1023 megabytes per second (Mbps). You can also designate the start and finish for **Work hours**, and which days of the week are considered Work days. The time outside of the designated Work hours is considered to be non-work hours.
4. Click **OK**.

## Manage exclusion settings
1. Open the **Microsoft Azure Backup agent** (you can find it by searching your machine for *Microsoft Azure Backup*).
   
    ![Schedule a Windows Server Backup](./media/backup-azure-manage-windows-server/snap-in-search.png)
