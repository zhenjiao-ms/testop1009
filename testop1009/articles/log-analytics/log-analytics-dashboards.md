# Create a custom dashboard in Log Analytics
This guide helps you understand how Log Analytics dashboards can visualize all of your saved log searches, giving you a single lens to view your environment.

![Example Dashboard](./media/log-analytics-dashboards/oms-dashboards-example-dash.png)

All the custom dashboards that you create in the OMS portal are also available in the OMS Mobile App. See the following pages for more information about the apps.

* [OMS mobile app from the Microsoft Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/store/app/operational-insights/4823b935-83ce-466c-82bb-bd0a3f58d865)
* [OMS mobile app from Apple iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/app/microsoft-operations-management/id1042424859?mt=8)

## How do I create my dashboard?
To begin, go to the OMS Overview page. You'll see the **My Dashboard** tile on the left. Click it to drill down into your dashboard.

## Adding a tile
In dashboards, tiles are powered by your saved log searches. OMS comes with many pre-made saved log searches, so you can begin right away. Use the following steps that outline how to begin.

In the My Dashboard view, simply click **Customize** to enter customize mode.

 The panel that opens on the right side of the page shows all of your workspace's saved log searches. To visualize a saved log search as a tile,  hover over a saved search and then click the **plus** symbol.

When you click the **plus** symbol, a new tile appears in the My Dashboard view.

### Tile visualizations
There are three kinds of tile visualizations to choose from:

| chart type | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| ![Bar Chart](./media/log-analytics-dashboards/oms-dashboards-bar-chart.png) |Displays a timeline of your saved log search's results as a bar chart, or a list of results by a field depending on if your log search aggregates results by a field or not. |
| ![metric](./media/log-analytics-dashboards/oms-dashboards-metric.png) |Displays your total log search result hits as a number in a tile. Metric tiles allow you to set a threshold that will highlight the tile when the threshold is reached. |
| ![line](./media/log-analytics-dashboards/oms-dashboards-line.png) |Displays a timeline of your saved log search result hits with values as a line chart. |

### Threshold
You can create a threshold on a tile using the Metric visualization. Select on to create a threshold value on the tile. Choose whether to highlight the tile when the value is over or under the chosen threshold, then set the threshold value below.

## Organizing the dashboard
To organize your dashboard, navigate to the My Dashboard view and click **Customize** to enter customize mode. Click and drag the tile you want to move, and move it to where you want your tile to be.

## Remove a tile
To remove a tile, navigate to the My Dashboard view and click **Customize** to enter customize mode. Select the tile you want to remove, then on the right panel select **Remove Tile**.
