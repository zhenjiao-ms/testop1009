If your Azure subscription becomes disabled, you can use the steps in this article to re-enable it. Your Azure subscription can become disabled for the following reasons.

## You have reached your spending limit
To protect you from accidentally incurring charges for usage beyond the included offer amount, we have introduced the [spending limit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spending-limits/) feature. When your usage exhausts the monthly amounts included in your offer, we will disable your service for the remainder of that billing month. You can opt to remove the spending limit to avoid this and [set up billing alerts for your Microsoft Azure subscriptions](billing-set-up-alerts.md) to help you monitor and manage billing activity for your Azure accounts.

Here is how you can remove your Spending Limit:

1. Log in to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Home/Index).
2. Click on **Subscriptions**.
3. Select a subscription.
4. If you see *Subscription reached the Spending Limit and has been disabled to prevent charges*, click on it.
   
    Alternatively, click **Remove spending limit** in the **Subscription Status** area.
5. Select one of the following options that is appropriate for youï¼š

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Remove spending limit indefinitely |Removes the spending limit without turning it on automatically at the start of the next billing period. |
| Remove spending limit for the current billing period |Removes the spending limit so that it turns back on automatically at the start of the next billing period. |

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using a Free Trial subscription, removing the spending limit will convert your subscription to Pay-As-You-Go at the end of the Free Trial.

## Your bill is past due
Pay your outstanding balance in full. To do this, see the article [Why have you received a notification that your Azure subscription has a past due balance?](billing-azure-subscription-past-due-balance.md#what-can-you-do-to-resolve-the-issue)

## The bill exceeds your credit card limit
To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods:

* [Switch to a different credit card](billing-how-to-change-credit-card.md).
* If you are a business, you can [switch to the invoice method of payment](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/invoicing/).

## The subscription has been cancelled by the Account Administrator
> [!NOTE]
> This method currently only applies to Pay As You Go subscriptions. For other subscription types, you'll need to [contact support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade).
> 
> 

If you are the account administrator, you can reactivate your Pay As You Go subscription by following the steps below:

* Select the cancelled subscription.
* Click on either of the **Reactivate** links on the subscription detail page.

## How to re-enable non-Pay As You Go subscriptions:
To reactivate a disabled subscription, you must create a support ticket: sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Help + support**>**New support request**.
