# Access control in Azure Data Lake Store
Data Lake Store implements an access control model that derives from HDFS, and in turn, from the POSIX access control model. This article summarizes the basics of the access control model for Data Lake Store. To learn more about the HDFS access control model see [HDFS Permissions Guide](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsPermissionsGuide.html).

## Access control lists on files and folders
There are two kinds of Acess control lists (ACLs) -  **Access ACLs** and **Default ACLs**.

* **Access ACLs** – These control access to an object. Files and Folders both have Access ACLs.
* **Default ACLs** – A "template" of ACLs associated with a folder that determine the Access ACLs for any child items created under that folder. Files do not have Default ACLs.

![Data Lake Store ACLs](./media/data-lake-store-access-control/data-lake-store-acls-1.png)

Both Access ACLs and Default ACLs have the same structure.

> [!NOTE]
> Changing the Default ACL on a parent does not affect the Access ACL or Default ACL of child items that already exist.

## Users and identities
Every file and folder has distinct permissions for these identities:

* The owning user of the file
* The owning group
* Named users
* Named groups
* All other users

The identities of users and groups are Azure Active Directory (AAD) identities so unless otherwise noted a "user", in the context of Data Lake Store, could either mean an AAD user or an AAD security group.

## Permissions
The permissions on a filesystem object are **Read**, **Write**, and **Execute** and they can be used on files and folders as shown in the table below.

|  | File | Folder |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Read (R)** |Can read the contents of a file |Requires **Read** and **Execute** to list the contents of the folder. |
| **Write (W)** |Can write or append to a file |Requires **Write & Execute** to create child items in a folder. |
| **Execute (X)** |Does not mean anything in the context of Data Lake Store |Required to traverse the child items of a folder. |

### Short forms for permissions
**RWX**is used to indicate **Read + Write + Execute**. A more condensed numeric form exists in which **Read=4**, **Write=2**, and **Execute=1** and their sum represents the permissions. Below are some examples.

| Numeric form | Short form | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7 |RWX |Read + Write + Execute |
| 5 |R-X |Read + Execute |
| 4 |R-- |Read |
| 0 |--- |No permissions |

### Permissions do not inherit
In the POSIX-style model used by Data Lake Store, permissions for an item are stored on the item itself. In other words, permissions for an item cannot be inherited from the parent items.

## Common scenarios related to permissions
Here are some common scenarios to understand what permissions are needed to perform certain operations on a Data Lake Store account.

### Permissions needed to read a file
![Data Lake Store ACLs](./media/data-lake-store-access-control/data-lake-store-acls-3.png)

* For the file to be read - the caller needs **Read** permissions
* For all the folders in the folder structure that contain the file - the caller needs **Execute** permissions

### Permissions needed to append to a file
![Data Lake Store ACLs](./media/data-lake-store-access-control/data-lake-store-acls-4.png)

* For the file to be appended to - the caller needs **Write** permissions
* For all the folders that contain the file - the caller needs **Execute** permissions

### Permissions needed to delete a file
![Data Lake Store ACLs](./media/data-lake-store-access-control/data-lake-store-acls-5.png)

* For the parent folder - the caller needs **Write + Execute** permissions
* For all the other folders in the file’s path - the caller needs **Execute** permissions

> [!NOTE]
> Write permissions on the file is not required to delete the file as long as the above two conditions are true.

### Permissions needed to enumerate a folder
![Data Lake Store ACLs](./media/data-lake-store-access-control/data-lake-store-acls-6.png)

* For the folder to enumerate - the caller needs **Read + Execute** permissions
* For all the ancestor folders - the caller needs **Execute** permissions

## Viewing permissions in the Azure portal
From the Data Lake Store account's **Data Explorer** blade, click **Access** to see the ACLs for a file or a folder. In the screenshot below, click Access to see the ACLs for the **catalog** folder under the **mydatastore** account.

![Data Lake Store ACLs](./media/data-lake-store-access-control/data-lake-store-show-acls-1.png)

After that, from the **Access** blade, click **Simple View** to see the simpler view.

![Data Lake Store ACLs](./media/data-lake-store-access-control/data-lake-store-show-acls-simple-view.png)

Click **Advanced View** to see the more advanced view.

![Data Lake Store ACLs](./media/data-lake-store-access-control/data-lake-store-show-acls-advance-view.png)

## The super user
A super user has the most rights of all the users in the Data Lake Store. A super user:

* has RWX Permissions to **all** file and folders
* can change the permissions on any file or folder.
* can change the owning user or owning group of any file or folder.

In Azure, a Data Lake Store account has several Azure roles:

* Owners
* Contributors
* Readers
* Etc.

Everyone in the **Owners** role for a Data Lake Store account is automatically a super-user for that account. To learn more about Azure Role Based Access Control (RBAC) see [Role-based access control](../active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure.md).

## The owning user
The user who created the item is automatically the owning user of the item. An owning user can:

* Change the permissions of a file that is owned
* Change the owning group of a file that is owned, as long as the owning user is also a member of the target group.

> [!NOTE]
> The owning user **can not** change the owning user of another owned file. Only super-users can change the owning user of a file or folder.
> 
> 

## The owning group
In the POSIX ACLs, every user is associated with a "primary group". For example, user "alice" may belong to the "finance" group. Alice may belong to multiple groups, but one group is always designated as her primary group. In POSIX, when Alice creates a file, the owning group of that file is set to her primary group, which in this case is "finance".

When a new filesystem item is created, Data Lake Store assigns a value to the owning group. 

* **Case 1** - The root folder "/". This folder is created when a Data Lake Store account is created. In this case the owning group is set to the user who created the account.
* **Case 2** (every other case) - When a new item is created, the owning group is copied from the parent folder.

The owning group can be changed by:

* Any super-users
* The owning user, if the owning user is also a member of the target group.

## Access check algorithm
The following illustration represents the access check algorithm for Data Lake Store accounts.

![Data Lake Store ACLs algorithm](./media/data-lake-store-access-control/data-lake-store-acls-algorithm.png)

## The mask and "effective permissions"
The **mask** is an RWX value that is used to limit access for **named users**, the **owning group**, and **named groups** when performing the Access Check algorithm. Here are the key concepts for the mask. 

* The mask creates "effective permissions", that is, it modifies the permissions at the time of Access Check.
* The mask can be directly edited by file owner and any super-users.
* The mask has the ability to remove permissions to create the effective permission. The mask **can not** add permissions to the effective permission. 

Let us look at some examples. Below, the mask is set to **RWX**, which means that the mask does not remove any permissions. Notice that the effective permissions for named user, owning group, and named group are not altered during the access check.

![Data Lake Store ACLs](./media/data-lake-store-access-control/data-lake-store-acls-mask-1.png)

In the example below, the mask is set to **R-X**. So, it **turns off the Write permission** for **named user**, **owning group**, and **named group** at the time of access check.

![Data Lake Store ACLs](./media/data-lake-store-access-control/data-lake-store-acls-mask-2.png)

For reference, here is where the mask for a file or folder appears in the Azure Portal.

![Data Lake Store ACLs](./media/data-lake-store-access-control/data-lake-store-show-acls-mask-view.png)

> [!NOTE]
> For a new Data Lake Store account, the mask for the Access ACL and Default ACL of the root folder ("/") are defaulted to RWX.
>

## Permissions on new files and folders
When a new file or folder is created under an existing folder, the Default ACL on the parent folder determines:

* A child folder’s Default ACL and Access ACL
* A child file's Access ACL (files do not have a Default ACL)

### A child file or folder's Access ACL
When a child file or folder is created, the parent's Default ACL is copied as the child file or folder's Access ACL. Also, if **other** user has RWX permissions in the parent's default ACL, it is completely removed from the child item's Access ACL.

![Data Lake Store ACLs](./media/data-lake-store-access-control/data-lake-store-acls-child-items-1.png)

In most scenarios, the above information is all you should need to know about how a child item’s Access ACL is determined. However, if you are familiar with POSIX systems and want to understand in-depth how this transformation is achieved, see the section [Umask’s role in creating the Access ACL for new files and folders](#umasks-role-in-creating-the-access-acl-for-new-files-and-folders) later in this article.

### A child folder's Default ACL
When a child folder is created under a parent folder, the parent folder's Default ACL is copied over, as it is, to the child folder's Default ACL.

![Data Lake Store ACLs](./media/data-lake-store-access-control/data-lake-store-acls-child-items-2.png)

## Advanced topics for understanding ACLs in Data Lake Store
Following are a couple of advanced topics to help you understand how ACLs are determined for Data Lake Store files or folders.

### Umask’s role in creating the Access ACL for new files and folders
In a POSIX-compliant system, the general concept is that umask is a 9-bit value on the parent folder used to transform the permission for **owning user**, **owning group**, and **other** on a new child file or folder's Access ACL. The bits of a umask identify which bits to turn off in the child item’s Access ACL. Thus it is used to selectively prevent the propagation of permissions for owning user, owning group, and other.

In an HDFS system, the umask is typically a site-wide configuration option that is controlled by administrators. Data Lake Store uses an **account-wide umask** that cannot be changed. The following table shows Data Lake Store's umask.

| User group | Setting | Effect on new child item's Access ACL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Owning user |--- |No effect |
| Owning group |--- |No effect |
| Other |RWX |Remove Read + Write + Execute |

The following illustration shows this umask in action. The net effect is to remove **Read + Write + Execute** for **other** user. Since the umask did not specify bits for **owning user** and **owning group**, those permissions are not transformed.

![Data Lake Store ACLs](./media/data-lake-store-access-control/data-lake-store-acls-umask.png) 

### The sticky bit
The sticky bit is a more advanced feature of a POSIX filesystem. In the context of Data Lake Store, it is unlikely that the sticky bit will be needed.

The table below shows how the sticky bit works in Data Lake Store.

| User group | File | Folder |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sticky bit **OFF** |No effect |No effect |
| Sticky bit **ON** |No effect |Prevents anyone except **super-users** and the **owning user** of a child item from deleting or renaming that child item. |

The sticky bit is not shown in the Azure Portal.

## Common questions for ACLs in Data Lake Store
Here are some questions that come up often with respect to ACLs in Data Lake Store.

### Do I have to enable support for ACLs?
No. Access control via ACLs is always on for a Data Lake Store account.

### What permissions are required to recursively delete a folder and its contents?
* The parent folder must have **Write + Execute**.
* The folder to be deleted, and every folder within it, requires **Read + Write + Execute**.
  > [!NOTE]
  > Deleting the files in folders does not requires Write on those files. Also, the Root folder "/" can **never** be deleted.
  > 
  > 

### Who is set as the owner of a file or folder?
The creator of a file or folder becomes the owner.

### Who is set as the owning group of a file or folder at creation?
It is copied from the owning group of the parent folder under which the new file or folder is created.

### I am the owning user of a file but I don’t have the RWX permissions I need. What do I do?
The owning user can simply change the permissions of the file to give themselves any RWX permissions they need.

### Does Data Lake Store support inheritance of ACLs?
No.

### What is the difference between mask and umask?
| mask | umask |
| --- | --- |
| The **mask** property is available on every file and folder. |The **umask** is a property of the Data Lake Store account. So, there is only a single umask in the Data Lake Store. |
| The mask property on a file or folder can be altered by the owning user or owning group of a file or a super-user. |The umask property cannot be modified by any user, even a super user. It is an unchangeable, constant value. |
| The mask property is used to during the Access Check algorithm at runtime to determine whether a user has the right to perform on operation on a file or folder. The role of the mask is to create "effective permissions" at the time of access check. |The umask is not used during Access Check at all. The umask is used to determine the Access ACL of new child items of a folder. |
| The mask is a 3-bit RWX value that applies to named user, named group, and owning user at the time of access check. |The umask is a 9 bit value that applies to the owning user, owning group, and other of a new child. |
