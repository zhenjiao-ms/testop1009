# Create an Azure Batch account using the Azure portal

Learn how to create an Azure Batch account in the [Azure portal][azure_portal], and where to find important account properties like access keys and account URLs. We also discuss Batch pricing, and linking an Azure Storage account to your Batch account so that you can use [application packages](batch-application-packages.md) and [persist job and task output](batch-task-output.md).

## Create a Batch account
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal][azure_portal].
2. Click **New** > **Virtual Machines** > **Batch Service**.
   
    ![Batch in the Marketplace][marketplace_portal]
3. The **New Batch Account** blade is displayed. See items *a* through *e* below for descriptions of each blade element.
   
    ![Create a Batch account][account_portal]
   
    a. **Account Name**: A unique name for your Batch account. This name must be unique within the Azure region the account is created (see *Location* below). It may contain only lowercase characters, numbers, and must be 3-24 characters in length.
   
    b. **Subscription**: A subscription in which to create the Batch account. If you have only one subscription, it is selected by default.
   
    c. **Resource group**: An existing resource group for your new Batch account, or optionally create a new one.
   
    d. **Location**: An Azure region in which to create the Batch account. Only the regions supported by your subscription and resource group are displayed as options.
   
    e. **Storage Account** (optional): A **General purpose** storage account you associate (link) to your new Batch account. See [Linked Azure Storage account](#linked-azure-storage-account) below for more details.
4. Click **Create** to create the account.
   
   The portal indicates that it is **Deploying** the account, and upon completion, a **Deployments succeeded** notification appears in *Notifications*.

## View Batch account properties
Once the account has been created, you can open the **Batch account blade** to access its settings and properties. You can access all account settings and properties by using the left menu of the Batch account blade.

![Batch account blade in Azure portal][account_blade]

* **Batch account URL**: Applications you create with the [Batch development APIs](batch-technical-overview.md#batch-development-apis) need an account URL to manage resources and run jobs in the account. A Batch account URL has the following format:
  
    `https://<account_name>.<region>.batch.azure.com`

![Batch account URL in portal][account_url]

* **Access keys**: Your applications also need an access key when working with resources in your Batch account. To view or regenerate your Batch account's access keys, enter `keys` in the left menu **Search** box on the Batch account blade, then select **Keys**.

## Pricing
Batch accounts are offered only in a "Free Tier," which means you aren't charged for the Batch account itself. You are charged for the underlying Azure compute resources that your Batch solutions consume, and for the resources consumed by other services when your workloads run. For example, you are charged for the compute nodes in your pools and for the data you store in Azure Storage as input or output for your tasks. Similarly, if you use the [application packages](batch-application-packages.md) feature of Batch, you are charged for the Azure Storage resources used for storing your application packages. See [Batch pricing][batch_pricing] for more information.

## Linked Azure Storage account
As mentioned earlier, you can (optionally) link a **General purpose** Storage account to your Batch account. The [application packages](batch-application-packages.md) feature of Batch uses blob storage in a linked General purpose Storage account, as does the [Batch File Conventions .NET](batch-task-output.md) library. These optional features assist you in deploying the applications your Batch tasks run, and persisting the data they produce.

Batch currently supports *only* the **General purpose** storage account type as described in step 5, [Create a storage account](../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md#create-a-storage-account), in [About Azure storage accounts](../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md). When you link an Azure Storage account to your Batch account, be sure link *only* a **General purpose** storage account.

![Creating a "General purpose" storage account][storage_account]

We recommend that you create a Storage account for exclusive use by your Batch account.

> [!WARNING]
> Take care when regenerating the access keys of a linked Storage account. Regenerate only one Storage account key and click **Sync Keys** on the linked Storage account blade. Wait five minutes to allow the keys to propagate to the compute nodes in your pools, then regenerate and synchronize the other key if necessary. If you regenerate both keys at the same time, your compute nodes will not be able to synchronize either key, and they will lose access to the Storage account.

## Batch service quotas and limits
Please be aware that as with your Azure subscription and other Azure services, certain [quotas and limits](batch-quota-limit.md) apply to Batch accounts. Current quotas for a Batch account appear in the portal in the account **Properties**.

![Batch account quotas in Azure portal][quotas]

Keep these quotas in mind as you are designing and scaling up your Batch workloads. For example, if your pool isn't reaching the target number of compute nodes you've specified, you might have reached the core quota limit for your Batch account.

Also note that you are not restricted to a single Batch account for your Azure subscription. You can run multiple Batch workloads in a single Batch account, or distribute your workloads among Batch accounts in the same subscription, but in different Azure regions.

Many of these quotas can be increased simply with a free product support request submitted in the Azure portal. See [Quotas and limits for the Azure Batch service](batch-quota-limit.md) for details on requesting quota increases.

## Other Batch account management options
In addition to using the Azure portal, you can also create and manage Batch accounts with the following:

* [Batch PowerShell cmdlets](batch-powershell-cmdlets-get-started.md)
* [Azure CLI](../xplat-cli-install.md)
* [Batch Management .NET](batch-management-dotnet.md)

## Next steps
* See the [Azure Batch feature overview](batch-api-basics.md) to learn more about Batch service concepts and features. The article discusses the primary Batch resources such as pools, compute nodes, jobs, and tasks, and provides an overview of the service's features that enable large-scale compute workload execution.
* Learn the basics of developing a Batch-enabled application using the [Batch .NET client library](batch-dotnet-get-started.md). The [introductory article](batch-dotnet-get-started.md) guides you through a working application that uses the Batch service to execute a workload on multiple compute nodes, and includes using Azure Storage for workload file staging and retrieval.
