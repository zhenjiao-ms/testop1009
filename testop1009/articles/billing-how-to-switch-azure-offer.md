## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
### What offer changes do you support?
See the list of [available offers you can switch to](#what-you-need-to-know).

### Where is the button?
You might not see **Switch to another offer** if:

* You're still on your first billing period; you must wait for your first billing period to complete before you can change offers.
* You're not eligible for any offer changes. Check the list of [available offers you can switch to](#what-you-need-to-know) to make sure your desired offer change is supported.

### Does switching offers have any impact to my service?
There is no service downtime. However, the offer you switch to may have restrictions. For instance, some offers prohibit production use. So you would need to move production resources to another subscription.

### Does switching offers have any impact to service administrators?
There is no impact to any users associated with the subscription.

### What billing-related changes can I expect upon switching offers?
On the day you switch, an invoice will be generated for all outstanding charges. Subsequently, your subscription will be billed per the new offer’s pricing terms. Your subscription billing anniversary changes to the date on which you changed offers. Usage and billing data prior to the offer change will not be retained, so we recommend that you download these prior to switching.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to billing-related constraints, offer changes are not possible within the first billing cycle after creating a subscription.

### Can I use this mechanism to migrate from web direct to [Cloud Solution Provider](https://partner.microsoft.com/Solutions/cloud-reseller-overview) (CSP), or an [Enterprise Agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/) (EA) offer?
This mechanism can be used to switch from - and to - only web direct offers. To move your existing subscription into EA, have your enrollment admin add your account into the EA. You will then receive an invitation email. When you follow the instructions to accept the invitation, your subscriptions will automatically be moved under the Enterprise Agreement. There is no option to move an existing web direct subscription into CSP today.
