# New Relic Application Performance Management on Azure
You can add New Relic's world-class performance monitoring to your Azure hosted applications. Along with comprehensive capabilities for monitoring, troubleshooting, and tuning your Azure apps, you are also eligible for a discounted price for New Relic products by using Azure.

## What is New Relic?
With [New Relic products](https://newrelic.com/products), you can solve app errors, stay ahead of potential issues, and understand the performance of your entire environment. It is designed to save you time when identifying and diagnosing performance issues, and it puts the information you need to solve these issues at your fingertips.

New Relic tracks the load time and throughput for your web transactions, both from the server and your users' browsers. It shows how much time you spend in the database, analyzes slow queries and web requests, provides uptime monitoring and alerting, tracks application exceptions, and a whole lot more. 

## Special pricing
New Relic Standard is free to Azure users. New Relic Pro is offered based on instance size for Azure Cloud Services. For pricing information, see the [New Relic page](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/partners/newrelic/newrelic/) in the Azure Marketplace or contact New Relic (sales@newrelic.com) for enterprise-level pricing.

Azure customers receive a two week trial subscription of New Relic Pro when they deploy the New Relic agent.

## Sign up for New Relic using the Azure Store
New Relic integrates seamlessly with Azure Web Roles and Worker roles. You can quickly and easily sign up for New Relic directly from the Azure Store. For instructions, see the [Azure store sign-up instructions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/azure-installation/azure-cloud-services#signup) from New Relic.

## View your data
Once you've signed up, you can take advantage of New Relic's amazing application monitoring and data-driven analysis. To check your app's performance in New Relic:

1. From the Azure Portal, select Manage.
2. Sign in with your New Relic account email and password.
