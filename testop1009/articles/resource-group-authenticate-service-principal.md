When you have an application or script that needs to access resources, you most likely do not want to run this process under your own credentials. You may have different permissions that you want for the application, and you do not want the application to continue using your credentials if your responsibilities change. Instead, you create an identity for the application that includes authentication credentials and role assignments. Every time the app runs, it authenticates itself with these credentials. This topic shows you how to use [Azure PowerShell](powershell-install-configure.md) to set up everything you need for an application to run under its own credentials and identity.

With PowerShell, you have two options for authenticating your AD application:

* password
* certificate

This topic shows how to use both options in PowerShell. If you intend to log in to Azure from a programming framework (such Python, Ruby, or Node.js), password authentication might be your best option. Before deciding whether to use a password or certificate, see the [Sample applications](#sample-applications) section for examples of authenticating in the different frameworks.

## Active Directory concepts
In this article, you create two objects - the Active Directory (AD) application and the service principal. The AD application is the global representation of your application. It contains the credentials (an application id and either a password or certificate). The service principal is the local representation of your application in an Active Directory. It contains the role assignment. This topic focuses on a single-tenant application where the application is intended to run within only one organization. You typically use single-tenant applications for line-of-business applications that run within your organization. In a single-tenant application, you have one AD app and one service principal.

You may be wondering - why do I need both objects? This approach makes more sense when you consider multi-tenant applications. You typically use multi-tenant applications for software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, where your application runs in many different subscriptions. For multi-tenant applications, you have one AD app and multiple service principals (one in each Active Directory that grants access to the app). To set up a multi-tenant application, see [Developer's guide to authorization with the Azure Resource Manager API](resource-manager-api-authentication.md).

## Required permissions
To complete this topic, you must have sufficient permissions in both your Azure Active Directory and your Azure subscription. Specifically, you must be able to create an app in the Active Directory, and assign the service principal to a role. 

In your Active Directory, your account must be an administrator (such as **Global Admin** or **User Admin**). If your account is assigned to the **User** role, you need to have an administrator elevate your permissions.

In your subscription, your account must have `Microsoft.Authorization/*/Write` access, which is granted through the [Owner](active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md#owner) role or [User Access Administrator](active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator) role. If your account is assigned to the **Contributor** role, you receive an error when attempting to assign the service principal to a role. Again, your subscription administrator must grant you sufficient access.

Now, proceed to a section for either [password](#create-service-principal-with-password) or [certificate](#create-service-principal-with-certificate) authentication.

## Create service principal with password
In this section, you perform the steps to:

* create the AD application with a password
* create the service principal
* assign the Reader role to the service principal

To quickly perform these steps, see the following three cmdlets. 

     $app = New-AzureRmADApplication -DisplayName "{app-name}" -HomePage "https://{your-domain}/{app-name}" -IdentifierUris "https://{your-domain}/{app-name}" -Password "{your-password}"
     New-AzureRmADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $app.ApplicationId
     New-AzureRmRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Reader -ServicePrincipalName $app.ApplicationId.Guid

Let's go through these steps more carefully to make sure you understand the process.

1. Sign in to your account.
   
        Add-AzureRmAccount
2. Create a new Active Directory application by providing a display name, the URI that describes your application, the URIs that identify your application, and the password for your application identity.
   
        $app = New-AzureRmADApplication -DisplayName "exampleapp" -HomePage "https://www.contoso.org/exampleapp" -IdentifierUris "https://www.contoso.org/exampleapp" -Password "<Your_Password>"
   
     For single-tenant applications, the URIs are not validated.
   
     If your account does not have the [required permissions](#required-permissions) on the Active Directory, you see an error message indicating "Authentication_Unauthorized" or "No subscription found in the context".
3. Examine the new application object. 
   
        $app
   
     Note in particular the **ApplicationId** property, which is needed for creating service principals, role assignments, and acquiring the access token.
   
        DisplayName             : exampleapp
        ObjectId                : c95e67a3-403c-40ac-9377-115fa48f8f39
        IdentifierUris          : {https://www.contoso.org/example}
        HomePage                : https://www.contoso.org
        Type                    : Application
        ApplicationId           : 8bc80782-a916-47c8-a47e-4d76ed755275
        AvailableToOtherTenants : False
        AppPermissions          : 
        ReplyUrls               : {}
4. Create a service principal for your application by passing in the application id of the Active Directory application.
   
        New-AzureRmADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $app.ApplicationId
5. Grant the service principal permissions on your subscription. In this example, you add the service principal to the **Reader** role, which grants permission to read all resources in the subscription. For other roles, see [RBAC: Built-in roles](active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md). For the **ServicePrincipalName** parameter, provide the **ApplicationId** that you used when creating the application. 
   
        New-AzureRmRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Reader -ServicePrincipalName $app.ApplicationId.Guid
   
    If your account does not have sufficient permissions to assign a role, you see an error message. The message states your account **does not have authorization to perform action 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write' over scope '/subscriptions/{guid}'**. 

That's it! Your AD application and service principal are set up. The next section shows you how to log in with the credential through PowerShell. If you want to use the credential in your code application, you can jump to the [Sample applications](#sample-applications). 

### Provide credentials through PowerShell
Now, you need to log in as the application to perform operations.

1. Create a **PSCredential** object that contains your credentials by running the **Get-Credential** command. You need the **ApplicationId** before running this command so make sure you have that available to paste.
   
        $creds = Get-Credential
2. You are prompted you to enter your credentials. For the user name, use the **ApplicationId** that you used when creating the application. For the password, use the one you specified when creating the account.
   
     ![enter credentials](./media/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal/arm-get-credential.png)
3. Whenever you sign in as a service principal, you need to provide the tenant id of the directory for your AD app. A tenant is an instance of Active Directory. If you only have one subscription, you can use:
   
        $tenant = (Get-AzureRmSubscription).TenantId
   
     If you have more than one subscription, specify the subscription where your Active Directory resides. For more information, see [How Azure subscriptions are associated with Azure Active Directory](active-directory/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory.md).
   
        $tenant = (Get-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "Contoso Default").TenantId
4. Log in as the service principal by specifying that this account is a service principal and by providing the credentials object. 
   
        Add-AzureRmAccount -Credential $creds -ServicePrincipal -TenantId $tenant
   
     You are now authenticated as the service principal for the Active Directory application that you created.

### Save access token to simplify log in
To avoid providing the service principal credentials every time it needs to log in, you can save the access token.

1. To use the current access token in a later session, save the profile.
   
        Save-AzureRmProfile -Path c:\Users\exampleuser\profile\exampleSP.json
   
     Open the profile and examine its contents. Notice that it contains an access token. 
2. Instead of manually logging in again, simply load the profile.
   
        Select-AzureRmProfile -Path c:\Users\exampleuser\profile\exampleSP.json

> [!NOTE]
> The access token expires, so using a saved profile only works for as long as the token is valid.
>

## Create service principal with certificate
In this section, you perform the steps to:

* create a self-signed certificate
* create the AD application with the certificate
* create the service principal
* assign the Reader role to the service principal

To quickly perform these steps with Azure PowerShell 2.0 on Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview, see the following cmdlets. 

    $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -CertStoreLocation "cert:\CurrentUser\My" -Subject "CN=exampleapp" -KeySpec KeyExchange
    $keyValue = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($cert.GetRawCertData())
    $app = New-AzureRmADApplication -DisplayName "exampleapp" -HomePage "https://www.contoso.org" -IdentifierUris "https://www.contoso.org/example" -CertValue $keyValue -EndDate $cert.NotAfter -StartDate $cert.NotBefore
    New-AzureRmADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $app.ApplicationId
    New-AzureRmRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Reader -ServicePrincipalName $app.ApplicationId.Guid

Let's go through these steps more carefully to make sure you understand the process. This article also shows how to accomplish the tasks when using earlier versions of Azure PowerShell or operating systems.

### Create the self-signed certificate
The version of PowerShell available with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview has an updated **New-SelfSignedCertificate** cmdlet for generating a self-signed certificate. Earlier operating systems have the New-SelfSignedCertificate cmdlet but it does not offer the parameters needed for this topic. Instead, you need to import a module to generate the certificate. This topic shows both approaches for generating the certificate based on the operating system you have. 

* If you have **Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview**, run the following command to create a self-signed certificate: 
  
        $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -CertStoreLocation "cert:\CurrentUser\My" -Subject "CN=exampleapp" -KeySpec KeyExchange
* If you **do not have Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview**, you need to download the [Self-signed certificate generator](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Self-signed-certificate-5920a7c6/) from Microsoft Script Center. Extract its contents and import the cmdlet you need.
  
        # Only run if you could not use New-SelfSignedCertificate
        Import-Module -Name c:\ExtractedModule\New-SelfSignedCertificateEx.ps1
  
     Then, generate the certificate.
  
        $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificateEx -Subject "CN=exampleapp" -KeySpec "Exchange" -FriendlyName "exampleapp"

You have your certificate and can proceed with creating your AD app.

### Create the Active Directory app and service principal
1. Retrieve the key value from the certificate.
   
        $keyValue = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($cert.GetRawCertData())
2. Sign in to your Azure account.
   
        Add-AzureRmAccount
3. Create a new Active Directory application by providing a display name, the URI that describes your application, the URIs that identify your application, and the password for your application identity.
   
     If you have Azure PowerShell 2.0 (August 2016 or later), use the following cmdlet:
   
        $app = New-AzureRmADApplication -DisplayName "exampleapp" -HomePage "https://www.contoso.org" -IdentifierUris "https://www.contoso.org/example" -CertValue $keyValue -EndDate $cert.NotAfter -StartDate $cert.NotBefore      
   
    If you have Azure PowerShell 1.0, use the following cmdlet:
   
        $app = New-AzureRmADApplication -DisplayName "exampleapp" -HomePage "https://www.contoso.org" -IdentifierUris "https://www.contoso.org/example" -KeyValue $keyValue -KeyType AsymmetricX509Cert  -EndDate $cert.NotAfter -StartDate $cert.NotBefore      
   
    For single-tenant applications, the URIs are not validated.
   
    If your account does not have the [required permissions](#required-permissions) on the Active Directory, you see an error message indicating "Authentication_Unauthorized" or "No subscription found in the context".
   
    Examine the new application object. 
   
        $app
   
    Notice the **ApplicationId** property, which is needed for creating service principals, role assignments, and acquiring access tokens.
   
        DisplayName             : exampleapp
        ObjectId                : c95e67a3-403c-40ac-9377-115fa48f8f39
        IdentifierUris          : {https://www.contoso.org/example}
        HomePage                : https://www.contoso.org
        Type                    : Application
        ApplicationId           : 8bc80782-a916-47c8-a47e-4d76ed755275
        AvailableToOtherTenants : False
        AppPermissions          : 
        ReplyUrls               : {}
4. Create a service principal for your application by passing in the application id of the Active Directory application.
   
        New-AzureRmADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $app.ApplicationId
5. Grant the service principal permissions on your subscription. In this example, you add the service principal to the **Reader** role, which grants permission to read all resources in the subscription. For other roles, see [RBAC: Built-in roles](active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md). For the **ServicePrincipalName** parameter, provide the **ApplicationId** that you used when creating the application.
   
        New-AzureRmRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Reader -ServicePrincipalName $app.ApplicationId.Guid
   
    If your account does not have sufficient permissions to assign a role, you see an error message. The message states your account **does not have authorization to perform action 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write' over scope '/subscriptions/{guid}'**.

That's it! Your AD application and service principal are set up. The next section shows you how to log in with certificate through PowerShell.

### Provide certificate through automated PowerShell script
Whenever you sign in as a service principal, you need to provide the tenant id of the directory for your AD app. A tenant is an instance of Active Directory. If you only have one subscription, you can use:

    $tenant = (Get-AzureRmSubscription).TenantId

If you have more than one subscription, specify the subscription where your Active Directory resides. For more information, see [Administer your Azure AD directory](active-directory/active-directory-administer.md).

    $tenant = (Get-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "Contoso Default").TenantId

To authenticate in your script, specify the account is a service principal and provide the certificate thumbprint, the application id, and tenant id. To automate your script, you can store these values as environment variables and retrieve them during execution, or you can include them in your script.

    Add-AzureRmAccount -ServicePrincipal -CertificateThumbprint $cert.Thumbprint -ApplicationId $app.ApplicationId -TenantId $tenant

You are now authenticated as the service principal for the Active Directory application that you created.
