# Debug C# code in U-SQL for Data Lake Analytics jobs
Learn how to use Azure Data Lake Visual Studio tools to debug failed U-SQL jobs due to bugs inside user code. 

The Visual Studio tool allows you to download compiled code and necessary vertex data from  cluster to trace and debug failed jobs .

Big data systems usually provide extensibility model through languages such as Java, C#, Python, etc. Many these systems provide limited runtime debugging information, that makes it hard to debug runtime errors in custom code. The latest Visual Studio tools comes with a feature called “Failed Vertex Debug”. Using this feature, you can download the runtime data from Azure to local workstation so that you can debug failed custom C# code using the same runtime and exact input data from the cloud.  After the problems are fixed, you can re-run the revised code in Azure from the tools.

For a video presentation of this feature, see [Debug your custom code in Azure Data Lake Analytics](https://mix.office.com/watch/1bt17ibztohcb).

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio may hang or crash if you don’t have the following two windows upgrades: [Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Update 2](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=51682), 
> [Universal C Runtime for Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=50410&wa=wsignin1.0).

## Prerequisites
* Have gone through the [Get started](data-lake-analytics-data-lake-tools-get-started.md) article.

## Create and configure debug projects
When you open a failed job in Data Lake Visual Studio tool, you will get an alert. The detailed error info will be shown in the error tab and the yellow alert bar on the top of the window.

**To download vertex and create a debug solution**

1. Open a failed U-SQL job in Visual Studio.
2. Click **Download** to download all the required resources and input streams. Click **Retry** if the download failed.
3. Click **Open** after the download is completed to create a local debug project. A new Visual Studio solution called **VertexDebug** with an empty project called **LocalVertexHost** will be created.

If user defined operators are used in U-SQL code behind (Script.usql.cs), you must create a Class Library C# project with the user defined operators code, and include the project in the VertexDebug Solution.

If you have registered .dll assemblies to your Data Lake Analytics database, you must add the source code of the assemblies to the VertexDebug Solution.

If you created a separate C# class library for your U-SQL code and registered .dll assemblies to your Data Lake Analytics database, you need to add the source C# project of the assemblies to the VertexDebug Solution.

In some rare cases, you use user defined operators in U-SQL code behind (Script.usql.cs) file in the original solution. If you want to make it work, you need to create a C# library containing the source code and change the assembly name to the one registered in the cluster. You can get the assembly name registered in the cluster by checking the script that got running in the cluster. You can do so by opening the U-SQL job and click “script” in the job panel. 

**To configure the solution**

1. From Solution explorer, right-click the C# project you just created, and then click **Properties**.
2. Set the Output path as LocalVertexHost project working directory path. You can get LocalVertexHost project Working Directory path through LocalVertexHost properties.
3. Build your C# project in order to put the .pdb file into the LocalVertexHost project Working Directory, or you can copy the .pdb file to this folder manually.
4. In **Exception Settings**, check Common Language Runtime Exceptions:

## Debug the job
After you have created a debug solution by downloading the vertex and have configured the environment, you can start debugging your U-SQL code.

1. From Solution Explorer, right-click the **LocalVertexHost** project you just created, point to **Debug**, and then click **Start new instance**. The LocalVertexHost must be set as the Startup project. You may see the following message for the first time which you can ignore. It can take up to one minute to get to the debug screen.

2. Use Visual Studio based debugging experience (watch, variables, etc.) to troubleshoot the problem. 
3. After you have identified an issue, fix the code, and then rebuild the C# project before testing it again until all the problems are resolved. After the debug has been completed successfully, the output window showing the following message 
   
     The Program ‘LocalVertexHost.exe’ has exited with code 0 (0x0).

## Resubmit the job
After you have completed debugging your U-SQL code, you can resubmit the failed job.

1. Register new .dll assemblies to your ADLA database.
   
   1. From Server Explorer/Cloud Explorer in Data Lake Visual Studio Tool, expand the **Databases** node 
   2. Right-click Assemblies to Register assemblies. 
   3. Register your new .dll assemblies to the ADLA database.
2. Or copy your C# code to script.usql.cs--C# code behind file.
3. Resubmit your job.
