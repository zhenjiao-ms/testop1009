## What are Service Bus topics and subscriptions?
Service Bus topics and subscriptions support a *publish/subscribe* messaging communication model. When using topics and subscriptions, components of a distributed application do not communicate directly with each other; instead they exchange messages via a topic, which acts as an intermediary.

In contrast with Service Bus queues, in which each message is processed by a single consumer, topics and subscriptions provide a "one-to-many" form of communication, using a publish/subscribe pattern. It is possible to
register multiple subscriptions to a topic. When a message is sent to a topic, it is then made available to each subscription to handle/process independently.

A subscription to a topic resembles a virtual queue that receives copies of the messages that were sent to the topic. You can optionally register filter rules for a topic on a per-subscription basis, which enables you to filter or restrict which messages to a topic are received by which topic subscriptions.

Service Bus topics and subscriptions enable you to scale and process a very large number of messages across many users and applications.

## Create a namespace
To begin using Service Bus topics and subscriptions in Azure, you must first create a *service namespace*. A namespace provides a scoping container for addressing Service Bus resources within your application.

To create a namespace:

1. Log on to the [Azure portal][Azure portal].
2. In the left navigation pane of the portal, click **New**, then click **Enterprise Integration**, and then click **Service Bus**.
3. In the **Create namespace** dialog, enter a namespace name. The system immediately checks to see if the name is available.
4. After making sure the namespace name is available, choose the pricing tier (Basic, Standard, or Premium).
5. In the **Subscription** field, choose an Azure subscription in which to create the namespace.
6. In the **Resource group** field, choose an existing resource group in which the namespace will live, or create a new one.      
7. In **Location**, choose the country or region in which your namespace should be hosted.
   
    ![Create namespace][create-namespace]
8. Click the **Create** button. The system now creates your namespace and enables it. You might have to wait several minutes as the system provisions resources for your account.

### Obtain the credentials
1. In the list of namespaces, click the newly created namespace name.
2. In the **Service Bus namespace** blade, click **Shared access policies**.
3. In the **Shared access policies** blade, click **RootManageSharedAccessKey**.
   
    ![connection-info][connection-info]
4. In the **Policy: RootManageSharedAccessKey** blade, click the copy button next to **Connection stringâ€“primary key**, to copy the connection string to your clipboard for later use.
   
    ![connection-string][connection-string]
