1. In the portal, navigate to the virtual network to which you want to connect a gateway.
2. In the **Settings** section of your VNet blade, click **Subnets** to expand the Subnets blade.
3. On the **Subnets** blade, click **+Gateway subnet** at the top. This will open the **Add subnet** blade. The **Name** for your subnet will automatically be filled in with the value 'GatewaySubnet'. This value is required in order for Azure to recognize the subnet as the gateway subnet.
