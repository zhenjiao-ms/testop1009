Take advantage of Microsoft HPC Pack and Azure compute and infrastructure services to create and manage a cloud-based high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. [HPC Pack](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj899572.aspx) is Microsoft's free HPC solution built on Microsoft Azure and Windows Server technologies and supports a wide range of HPC workloads. A cloud-based HPC Pack cluster provides a cluster administrator or independent software vendor (ISV) a flexible, scalable platform to run compute-intensive applications. It can also help reduce your investments in an on-premises compute cluster. For other options to run HPC and batch workloads in Azure, see [Technical resources for batch and high-performance computing](../articles/batch/big-compute-resources.md).
