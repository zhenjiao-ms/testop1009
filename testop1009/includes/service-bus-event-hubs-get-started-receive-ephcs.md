## Receive messages with EventProcessorHost
[EventProcessorHost][EventProcessorHost] is a .NET class that simplifies receiving events from Event Hubs by managing persistent checkpoints and parallel receives from those Event Hubs. Using [EventProcessorHost][EventProcessorHost], you can split events across multiple receivers, even when hosted in different nodes. This example shows how to use [EventProcessorHost][EventProcessorHost] for a single receiver. The [Scaled out event processing][Scaled out event processing] sample shows how to use [EventProcessorHost][EventProcessorHost] with multiple receivers.

To use [EventProcessorHost][EventProcessorHost], you must have an [Azure Storage account][Azure Storage account]:

1. Log on to the [Azure portal][Azure portal], and click **New** at the top left of the screen.
2. Click **Data + Storage**, then click **Storage account**.
   
    ![][1]
3. In the **Create storage account** blade, type a name for the storage account. Choose an Azure subscription, resource group, and location in which to create the resource. Then click **Create**.
   
    ![][2]
4. In the list of storage accounts, click the newly-created storage account.
5. In the storage account blade, click **Access keys**. Copy the value of **key1** to use later in this tutorial.
   
    ![][3]
6. In Visual Studio, create a new Visual C# Desktop App project using the **Console  Application** project template. Name the project **Receiver**.
   
    ![][14]
7. In Solution Explorer, right-click the solution, and then click **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution**.
8. Click the **Browse** tab, then search for `Microsoft Azure Service Bus Event Hub - EventProcessorHost`. Ensure that the project name (**Receiver**) is specified in the **Version(s)** box. Click **Install**, and accept the terms of use.
   
    ![][13]
   
    Visual Studio downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the [Azure Service Bus Event Hub - EventProcessorHost NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus.EventProcessorHost), with all its dependencies.
9. Right-click the **Receiver** project, click **Add**, and then click **Class**. Name the new class **SimpleEventProcessor**, and then click **Add** to create the class.
   
    ![][15]
10. Add the following statements at the top of the SimpleEventProcessor.cs file:
    
     ```
     using Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging;
     using System.Diagnostics;
     ```
    
     Then, substitute the following code for the body of the class:
    
     ```
     class SimpleEventProcessor : IEventProcessor
     {
         Stopwatch checkpointStopWatch;
    
         async Task IEventProcessor.CloseAsync(PartitionContext context, CloseReason reason)
         {
             Console.WriteLine("Processor Shutting Down. Partition '{0}', Reason: '{1}'.", context.Lease.PartitionId, reason);
             if (reason == CloseReason.Shutdown)
             {
                 await context.CheckpointAsync();
             }
         }
    
         Task IEventProcessor.OpenAsync(PartitionContext context)
         {
             Console.WriteLine("SimpleEventProcessor initialized.  Partition: '{0}', Offset: '{1}'", context.Lease.PartitionId, context.Lease.Offset);
             this.checkpointStopWatch = new Stopwatch();
             this.checkpointStopWatch.Start();
             return Task.FromResult<object>(null);
         }
    
         async Task IEventProcessor.ProcessEventsAsync(PartitionContext context, IEnumerable<EventData> messages)
         {
             foreach (EventData eventData in messages)
             {
                 string data = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(eventData.GetBytes());
    
                 Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Message received.  Partition: '{0}', Data: '{1}'",
                     context.Lease.PartitionId, data));
             }
    
             //Call checkpoint every 5 minutes, so that worker can resume processing from 5 minutes back if it restarts.
             if (this.checkpointStopWatch.Elapsed > TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5))
             {
                 await context.CheckpointAsync();
                 this.checkpointStopWatch.Restart();
             }
         }
     }
     ```
    
     This class will be called by the **EventProcessorHost** to process events received from the Event Hub. Note that the `SimpleEventProcessor` class uses a stopwatch to periodically call the checkpoint method on the **EventProcessorHost** context. This ensures that, if the receiver is restarted, it will lose no more than five minutes of processing work.
11. In the **Program** class, add the following `using` statement at the top of the file:
    
     ```
     using Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging;
     ```
    
     Then, replace the `Main` method in the `Program` class with the following code, substituting the Event Hub name and the namespace-level connection string that you saved previously, and the storage account and key that you copied in the previous sections. 
    
     ```
     static void Main(string[] args)
     {
       string eventHubConnectionString = "{Event Hub connection string}";
       string eventHubName = "{Event Hub name}";
       string storageAccountName = "{storage account name}";
       string storageAccountKey = "{storage account key}";
       string storageConnectionString = string.Format("DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName={0};AccountKey={1}", storageAccountName, storageAccountKey);
    
       string eventProcessorHostName = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
       EventProcessorHost eventProcessorHost = new EventProcessorHost(eventProcessorHostName, eventHubName, EventHubConsumerGroup.DefaultGroupName, eventHubConnectionString, storageConnectionString);
       Console.WriteLine("Registering EventProcessor...");
       var options = new EventProcessorOptions();
       options.ExceptionReceived += (sender, e) => { Console.WriteLine(e.Exception); };
       eventProcessorHost.RegisterEventProcessorAsync<SimpleEventProcessor>(options).Wait();
    
       Console.WriteLine("Receiving. Press enter key to stop worker.");
       Console.ReadLine();
       eventProcessorHost.UnregisterEventProcessorAsync().Wait();
     }
     ```

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial uses a single instance of [EventProcessorHost][EventProcessorHost]. To increase throughput, it is recommended that you run multiple instances of [EventProcessorHost][EventProcessorHost], as shown in the [Scaled out event processing][Scaled out event processing] sample. In those cases, the various instances automatically coordinate with each other to load balance the received events. If you want multiple receivers to each process *all* the events, you must use the **ConsumerGroup** concept. When receiving events from different machines, it might be useful to specify names for [EventProcessorHost][EventProcessorHost] instances based on the machines (or roles) in which they are deployed. For more information about these topics, see the [Event Hubs Overview][Event Hubs Overview] and [Event Hubs Programming Guide][Event Hubs Programming Guide] topics.
